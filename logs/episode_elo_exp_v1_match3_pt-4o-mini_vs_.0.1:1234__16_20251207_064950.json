NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone.

WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Sandra, Daniel, Michael, Anthony, Linda, Stephen, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Sandra's) goal: Act openly and collaboratively to identify werewolves.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf.

Michael, I appreciate you inspected Sandra, but claiming she\u2019s a Villager so quickly might just be a way to build trust if you have ulterior motives.

The game begins!\nDaniel: [action] kill Sandra\n\nTurn #1: Anthony: [action] kill Daniel\n[Game] Entering state: Night_seer\n\nTurn #2: [Game] Entering state: Night_witch\n\nTurn #3: [Game] An attack was prevented!\n[Game] Entering state: Day_discussion\n\nTurn #4: Sandra: said: \"Good morning everyone. I'm glad the attack was prevented\u2014someone must have used the witch's save potion! Let\u2019s work together to figure out who the werewolves are. Since no one died, we have a rare opportunity to analyze behavior and build trust. I\u2019m open to anyone\u2019s thoughts\u2014Daniel, Michael, Anthony, Linda, Stephen: what did you all notice during the night? Let\u2019s be honest and collaborative.\"\n\nTurn #5: Daniel: said: \"\"I agree with Sandra, it\u2019s a good opportunity to gather information. However, I believe we should also consider who may have had the motive to attack me. I think it\u2019s important to analyze our discussions from the previous day. What were we all talking about? Maybe we can find some clues there. I\u2019m ready to hear everyone\u2019s thoughts, but I\u2019d be cautious about jumping to conclusions because this is just the beginning.\"\"\n\nTurn #6: Michael: said: \"I agree with Sandra and Daniel\u2014we have a rare chance to build trust since no one died. I inspected Sandra last night, and she\u2019s definitely a Villager, so we can trust her lead. But I\u2019m curious: why did the attack get prevented? Did someone else use the witch\u2019s save potion, or was it a misdirect? Let\u2019s keep an eye on who seems too eager to defend others\u2014or too quiet. I\u2019m listening.\"\n\nTurn #7: Anthony: said: \"\"I think it's great that no one died last night, but let's not forget that someone's out there trying to eliminate us. Michael, I appreciate you inspected Sandra, but claiming she\u2019s a Villager so quickly might just be a way to build trust if you have ulterior motives. I'd caution everyone to stay vigilant and consider that trust can be manipulated. We need to be mindful of people's reactions and avoid making assumptions based solely on one inspection. Let's not overlook anything, especially any awkward or suspicious behaviors during our discussions!\"\"\n\nTurn #8: Linda: said: \"Michael, I appreciate your inspection of Sandra\u2014it\u2019s helpful to know she\u2019s a Villager. But Anthony raises a good point: if you\u2019re the Seer, why didn\u2019t you inspect someone else? It\u2019s suspicious that you immediately declared Sandra safe without checking anyone else. I\u2019m not accusing you yet, but your timing is odd. Let\u2019s hear from Anthony and Stephen next\u2014what do they think about the fact that Sandra was saved? And Linda, did you use the save potion? Be honest.\"\n\nTurn #9: Stephen: said: \"Linda, I understand your suspicion about Michael\u2019s inspection\u2014why target Sandra first? But let\u2019s not jump to conclusions. If Michael were a werewolf, he\u2019d have no reason to reveal a Villager; that hurts his side. More likely, he\u2019s the Seer and chose Sandra because she spoke first and seemed trustworthy. As for me\u2014I\u2019m just an ordinary villager trying to help us survive. I didn\u2019t do anything at night, and I\u2019m not hiding anything. The fact that the attack was saved means someone used the save potion, and it wasn\u2019t me. I\u2019m curious: who else might have been targeted? Daniel mentioned being a potential target\u2014was he acting nervous last night? Let\u2019s look for patterns, not just accusations.\"\n[Game] Entering state: Day_vote\n\nTurn #10: Sandra: [action] vote Michael\nDaniel: [action] vote Michael\nMichael: [action] vote Anthony\nAnthony: [action] vote Michael\nLinda: [action] vote Michael\nStephen: [action] vote Michael\n[Game] Michael was voted out!\n[Game] Entering state: Night_werewolf\n\nTurn #11: Daniel: [action] kill Anthony\n\nTurn #12: Anthony: [action] kill Daniel\n[Game] Entering state: Night_seer\n\nTurn #13: [Game] Entering state: Night_witch\n\nTurn #14: [Game] Anthony was killed by werewolves!\n[Game] Entering state: Day_discussion\n\nTurn #15: Sandra: said: \"Anthony was killed last night\u2014that\u2019s devastating. We lost a thoughtful player who raised important concerns about trust and manipulation. Michael was voted out yesterday, but now I\u2019m wondering: if he was truly the Seer and confirmed I was a Villager, why did the werewolves target Anthony instead of me? That suggests Michael might have been a Werewolf trying to eliminate a threat by framing Anthony. Or worse\u2014maybe the real Seer is still alive and we\u2019ve lost a key ally. Linda, Stephen: did either of you inspect anyone last night? We need to rebuild our information fast. I believe we should focus on who benefited from Anthony\u2019s death\u2014and who stayed unusually quiet during the night. Let\u2019s not let fear divide us; let\u2019s use logic.\"\n\nTurn #16: Daniel: said: \"\"I find Sandra's observations to be quite revealing. It\u2019s important we consider the implications of Anthony's death, but we also need to remember that blaming Michael blindly without giving proper thought to his claims can swing the momentum unfairly. We have to analyze each player's actions and statements thoroughly. Sandra, since you're leading the charge, it would help if you could clarify what you think about the accusations being thrown at Michael. I also recall that Anthony raised valid points about trust\u2014perhaps we should explore Stephen and Linda's roles a bit more. Let\u2019s not forget that accusations made in haste can lead to the downfall of the villagers\u2014let\u2019s base our strategy on concrete evidence and behavioral patterns. What do you all think about the next steps?\"\"\n\nTurn #17: Linda: said: \"Sandra, Daniel\u2014thank you for your thoughts. Anthony\u2019s death is a blow, but let\u2019s not misinterpret it. If Michael was the Seer and confirmed you were a Villager, Sandra, then the werewolves killing Anthony makes sense: they eliminated someone who was actively questioning Michael\u2019s credibility, which could have led to their exposure. That means Anthony was likely a Villager too\u2014and we just lost our best critical thinker. I used the poison potion last night because I believed Anthony was a Werewolf trying to sow doubt about Michael\u2019s inspection. But now\u2026 I\u2019m not so sure. If Anthony was innocent, then we were tricked into killing our own. I need to know: who did you two suspect before the vote? And Stephen\u2014did you see anything during the night that might clarify who\u2019s truly on our side?\"\n\nTurn #18: Stephen: said: \"Linda, I understand your reasoning about using the poison potion\u2014you thought Anthony was a threat, but now it\u2019s clear we may have lost an innocent. That\u2019s devastating. Sandra and Daniel, I agree we need to be careful not to misinterpret events. Michael was voted out, and now Anthony is dead\u2014two players gone in two days. If Michael really was the Seer, and he told the truth about Sandra being a Villager, then the werewolves killed Anthony to silence someone who was digging too deep. That means the real threat is still among us. I didn\u2019t inspect anyone last night, but I\u2019m not hiding anything\u2014I\u2019m just a Villager trying to survive. Let\u2019s focus on the remaining players: Sandra, Daniel, Linda, and me. Who among us has shown consistent logic? Who\u2019s been avoiding direct answers? I think we need to be honest: if the Seer is still alive, they must act now. Linda, you used poison\u2014do you have any new suspicions? Or are we all just guessing?\"\n[Game] Entering state: Day_vote\n\nTurn #19: Sandra: [action] vote Linda\nDaniel: [action] vote Sandra\nLinda: [action] vote Sandra\nStephen: [action] vote Linda\n[Game] Linda was voted out!\n[Game] Entering state: Night_werewolf\n\n\nYour available action type(s): [action].\nIt is Night.
