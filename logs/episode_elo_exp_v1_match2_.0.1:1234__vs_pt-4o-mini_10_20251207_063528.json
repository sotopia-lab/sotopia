WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed.

NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone.

WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Betty, Nicholas, Emma, Rebecca, Eric, James, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (James's) goal: Act openly and collaboratively to identify werewolves.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf. The game begins!\n\nTurn #1: [Game] Entering state: Night_seer\n\nTurn #2: [Game] Entering state: Night_witch\n\nTurn #3: [Game] Entering state: Day_discussion\n\nTurn #4: Betty: said: \"Good morning, everyone. Let's discuss what happened during the night. We need to work together to identify the werewolves. Who has any suspicions or observations?\"\n\nTurn #5: Nicholas: said: \"Good morning, everyone. Let's discuss what happened during the night. We need to work together to identify the werewolves. Who has any suspicions or observations?\"\n\nTurn #6: Emma: said: \"I think we need to consider who was acting suspiciously last night. I inspected Betty, and she is a Villager. So we can trust her for now. Let\u2019s keep our eyes on the rest of us, especially those who haven\u2019t spoken much.\"\n\nTurn #7: Rebecca: said: \"Good morning, everyone. Let's discuss what happened during the night. We need to work together to identify the werewolves. Who has any suspicions or observations?\"\n\nTurn #8: Eric: said: \"I agree with Emma. We should focus on those who haven't been vocal yet. Nicholas and Rebecca, you both have been quite quiet. I\u2019d like to hear your thoughts.\"\n\nTurn #9: James: said: \"I agree with Emma and Eric. It's crucial that we scrutinize those who remain quiet during our discussions. Rebecca and Nicholas, could you please share your thoughts? We need everyone's input to identify who the werewolves might be.\"\n[Game] Entering state: Day_vote\n\nTurn #10: Betty: [action] vote Nicholas\nNicholas: [action] vote Alice\nEmma: [action] vote Nicholas\nRebecca: [action] vote NAME\nEric: [action] vote Rebecca\nJames: [action] vote Nicholas\n[Game] Nicholas was voted out!\n[Game] Entering state: Night_werewolf\n\nTurn #11: [Game] Entering state: Night_seer\n\nTurn #12: [Game] Entering state: Night_witch\n\nTurn #13: [Game] Entering state: Day_discussion\n\nTurn #14: Betty: said: \"\"Good morning again, everyone. As we start our discussion, let\u2019s reflect on yesterday's vote. We voted out Nicholas based on suspicions of him being a werewolf. Emma also confirmed I'm a Villager. I think it's essential to analyze the reactions of those who were supportive of Nicholas and those who remained silent. Rebecca seemed quiet during the votes and didn't speak up much\u2014what do you think, Rebecca?\"\"\n\nTurn #15: Emma: said: \"I agree with Betty\u2019s point about analyzing reactions. I inspected Rebecca last night, and she is on the Werewolf team. We need to keep a close eye on her actions moving forward and consider her as a prime suspect.\"\n\nTurn #16: Rebecca: said: \"I think we need to work together to identify the werewolves. Who has any suspicions or observations?\"\n\nTurn #17: Eric: said: \"I want to address Rebecca directly. Emma just inspected you and found that you're a Werewolf. I think we need to seriously consider this information and discuss how to deal with this situation. Rebecca, what do you have to say for yourself?\"\n\nTurn #18: James: said: \"I want to add to the discussion. Since Emma inspected you, Rebecca, and revealed that you're a Werewolf, your insistence on wanting to talk seems like an attempt to divert suspicion. I think it\u2019s time we seriously consider voting you out for the safety of the villagers.\"\n[Game] Entering state: Day_vote\n\n\nYour available action type(s): [action].\nIt is voting time.
