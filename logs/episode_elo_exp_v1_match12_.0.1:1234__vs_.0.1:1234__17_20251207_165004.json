WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone.

Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed.

Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act.

Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed.

Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Robert, Helen, Mark, Amy, Sarah, Stephen, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Stephen's) goal: Act openly and collaboratively to identify werewolves.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf. The game begins!\n\nTurn #1: [Game] Entering state: Night_seer\n\nTurn #2: [Game] Entering state: Night_witch\n\nTurn #3: [Game] Entering state: Day_discussion\n\nTurn #4: Robert: said: \"Good morning everyone. I don't know who the werewolves are yet, but I'm here to help find them through honest discussion. Let's share what we saw or suspect\u2014no one should be silent. Helen, you're first. What did you notice last night?\"\n\nTurn #5: Helen: said: \"I noticed Bob was raising a knife. I'm not sure if he\u2019s a werewolf or villager, but he seemed agitated.\"\n\nTurn #6: Mark: said: \"Helen, you said Bob was raising a knife\u2014did you mean Robert? I didn\u2019t see anything unusual last night, but I\u2019m concerned about the confusion. Let\u2019s stay calm and focus on facts. Sarah, what do you think?\"\n\nTurn #7: Amy: said: \"I noticed Bob was raising a knife. I'm not sure if he\u2019s a werewolf or villager, but he seemed agitated.\"\n\nTurn #8: Sarah: said: \"I heard both Helen and Amy mention Robert raising a knife, but I didn\u2019t see anything like that. This seems suspicious\u2014why are they both pointing at Robert? Could this be a coordinated attempt to misdirect us? I think we need to be careful about who\u2019s repeating the same story. Mark, you didn\u2019t see anything\u2014do you think Helen and Amy might be working together?\"\n\nTurn #9: Stephen: said: \"I'm concerned that Helen and Amy both mentioned Robert raising a knife\u2014this is too coincidental. If they\u2019re both villagers, why are they saying the exact same thing? That feels like a setup. Robert, you didn\u2019t do anything wrong\u2014I believe you\u2019re innocent. But Helen and Amy, I need to know: why are your stories identical? This isn\u2019t just suspicion; it\u2019s a red flag. Sarah, you\u2019re right to question this. Let\u2019s focus on them.\"\n[Game] Entering state: Day_vote\n\nTurn #10: Robert: [action] vote Helen\nHelen: [action] vote name\nMark: [action] vote Helen\nAmy: [action] vote\nSarah: [action] vote Helen\nStephen: [action] vote Helen\n[Game] Helen was voted out!\n[Game] Entering state: Night_werewolf\n\nTurn #11: [Game] Entering state: Night_seer\n\nTurn #12: [Game] Entering state: Night_witch\n\nTurn #13: [Game] Entering state: Day_discussion\n\nTurn #14: Robert: said: \"Helen is gone, and I\u2019m still trying to understand what happened. Amy repeated the same claim about me raising a knife\u2014this feels too coordinated. Mark and Sarah didn\u2019t see anything, but Helen and Amy both pointed at me with identical wording. That\u2019s not coincidence; it\u2019s a tactic. I still believe I\u2019m innocent, but Amy is now the most suspicious person left. Let\u2019s watch her closely.\"\n\nTurn #15: Mark: said: \"I agree with Robert\u2014Amy\u2019s repetition of the exact same claim about Robert raising a knife is highly suspicious. I didn\u2019t see anything last night, but the timing and wording match Helen\u2019s exactly, even though she\u2019s gone now. That\u2019s not a coincidence; it\u2019s a werewolf tactic to frame an innocent player. Amy, you need to explain why your story is identical to Helen\u2019s. If you\u2019re innocent, clarify what you actually saw\u2014but if you\u2019re hiding something, now\u2019s the time to come clean.\"\n\nTurn #16: Amy: said: \"I think they are working together.  Let's focus on their dialogue and look for inconsistencies.\"\n\nTurn #17: Sarah: said: \"Amy, your statement is evasive. You\u2019re deflecting by accusing others instead of explaining why your claim about Robert raising a knife matches Helen\u2019s word-for-word. That\u2019s not just suspicion\u2014it\u2019s a pattern. If you\u2019re innocent, say what you actually saw. Otherwise, this looks like a werewolf trying to eliminate Robert by copying Helen\u2019s testimony. I\u2019m starting to think you\u2019re one of them.\"\n\nTurn #18: Stephen: said: \"I understand the suspicion around Amy, but let\u2019s not jump to conclusions. Helen and Amy both mentioned Robert raising a knife\u2014but what if they\u2019re both telling the truth? Maybe Robert did something unusual that others noticed independently. Alternatively, maybe someone is manipulating the narrative to make us doubt each other. Amy\u2019s evasiveness is concerning, but so is the fact that Robert, Mark, and Sarah are all ganging up on her with identical accusations. That\u2019s also suspicious. Let\u2019s think: who benefits if Amy is eliminated? If she\u2019s a villager, we lose a key voice. If she\u2019s a werewolf, then Robert might be covering for his partner. I\u2019m not convinced yet\u2014but I agree we need clarity. Amy, can you tell us what you *actually* saw? Not what you heard Helen say\u2014what did your eyes see?\"\n[Game] Entering state: Day_vote\n\n\nYour available action type(s): [action].\nIt is voting time.
