WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Mary, Justin, Jennifer, Nicholas, Emily, Ronald, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Justin's) goal: Deceive others, avoid detection, and eliminate villagers.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Mary, Justin, Jennifer, Nicholas, Emily, Ronald, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Ronald's) goal: Act openly and collaboratively to identify werewolves.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf.

If Nicholas was indeed a werewolf, that would be a major revelation, but I need to point out that the seer only reveals one player per night, and we don't know if that inspection was accurate or if it was a setup. Also, the witch's save potion was used on Nicholas \u2014 that means Nicholas was not killed, and if he were a werewolf, the witch might have saved him intentionally. I don't think we should jump to conclusions based on a single inspection. Let's keep our suspicions grounded in the facts and avoid making assumptions. I'm still open to hearing more about everyone's thoughts.\"\n\nTurn #9: Ronald: said: \"Thank you, Emily, for pointing that out \u2014 it's important to be careful about assumptions. I agree that we shouldn't base our suspicions solely on a single inspection or a save. Also, the fact that Nicholas was saved by the witch does suggest something, but it doesn't prove anything. I'm still open-minded and willing to listen to everyone's thoughts. Let's keep the discussion fair and focused on the facts we have. I don't have any strong suspects right now, but I'm paying close attention to who acts unusually or who might be trying to mislead us.\"\n[Game] Entering state: Day_vote\n\nTurn #10: Mary: [action] vote Nicholas\nJustin: [action] vote Alice\nJennifer: [action] vote Emily\nNicholas: [action] vote Alice\nEmily: [action] vote Justin\nRonald: [action] vote Emily\n[Game] Emily was voted out!\n[Game] Entering state: Night_werewolf\n\nTurn #11: [No recent activity]\n\nTurn #12: [Game] Entering state: Night_seer\n\nTurn #13: [Game] Entering state: Night_witch\n\nTurn #14: [Game] Entering state: Day_discussion\n\nTurn #15: Mary: said: \"I want to address the recent vote and the situation with Nicholas. First, I'd like to clarify that I voted for Nicholas, not because I believed he was a werewolf, but because I thought his survival \u2014 especially after being saved by the witch \u2014 was suspicious. The witch's save potion is a powerful tool, and if used on someone who is a werewolf, it could be a deliberate act to protect a wolf. That raises questions. However, we now have Emily out, and I believe we need to be cautious about making assumptions. Emily pointed out important facts about the seer and witch mechanics, and her removal may have been a misstep. I don't think Nicholas is a werewolf, but I also don't think we can rule him out just yet. I'm open to hearing what others think \u2014 especially about who might be acting in a way that suggests a wolf.

Let's discuss who might be a suspect and make sure we stay on the same page.\"\n\nTurn #17: Jennifer: said: \"I just want to add that Emily was a villager, as confirmed by the seer's inspection last night. This means the witch's save on Nicholas was likely not a protective action for a werewolf, but rather a neutral or possibly even accidental use. Since Emily is now out, I'm more cautious about trusting any claims that might be based on her statements. I still believe we need to keep a close eye on Nicholas \u2014 he was inspected and saved, which might be suspicious, but it's not enough to prove he's a werewolf. I'm not voting for him, but I'll continue to monitor his behavior during the day. I think we should remain vigilant and avoid forming conclusions too quickly.\"\n\nTurn #18: Nicholas: said: \"I'm Mary, and I'm here to help us work together to find the werewolves.
