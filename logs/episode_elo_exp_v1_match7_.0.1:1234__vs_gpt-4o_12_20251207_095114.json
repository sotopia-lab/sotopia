WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Emily, Jessica, Cynthia, Stephanie, Lisa, Charles, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Cynthia's) goal: Discreetly inspect players at night to uncover werewolves.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf.

Perhaps they have some valuable information to help us narrow down our suspects. Let's focus on sharing any insights or suspicions we have to catch these werewolves. Anyone have any thoughts?\"\n\nTurn #5: Jessica: said: \"I think it's suspicious that no one died last night\u2014especially since two werewolves were active. Either the Witch saved someone, or one of the wolves didn't follow through. But if the Seer inspected someone and saw a wolf, they\u2019d have spoken up by now to protect their target. My guess? The Seer is lying low, maybe because they\u2019re scared or even one of the wolves. We should focus on who stayed quiet\u2014Emily\u2019s asking for insights, but she\u2019s also the first to speak. That feels too convenient.\"\n\nTurn #6: Cynthia: said: \"I agree with Emily that we were indeed fortunate last night with the attack being prevented.

Given her claim of inspecting Jessica and identifying her as a werewolf, it aligns with the fact that an attack happened but was stopped by my save. I'm inclined to trust Cynthia's judgment for now. Let's think strategically. Cynthia seems legitimate in her claims, so accusing her may steer us away from the true threat. My suggestion? Focus our votes on Jessica and see the outcome.

The fact that the attack was prevented due to Lisa's intervention further lends credibility to Cynthia's claim as the Seer.

Since we have no casualties, it would be interesting to hear what the Seer might have gathered if they inspected someone last night. Perhaps they have some valuable information to help us narrow down our suspects. Let's focus on sharing any insights or suspicions we have to catch these werewolves. Anyone have any thoughts?\"\n\nTurn #5: Jessica: said: \"I think it's suspicious that no one died last night\u2014especially since two werewolves were active. Either the Witch saved someone, or one of the wolves didn't follow through. But if the Seer inspected someone and saw a wolf, they\u2019d have spoken up by now to protect their target. My guess? The Seer is lying low, maybe because they\u2019re scared or even one of the wolves. We should focus on who stayed quiet\u2014Emily\u2019s asking for insights, but she\u2019s also the first to speak. That feels too convenient.\"\n\nTurn #6: Cynthia: said: \"I agree with Emily that we were indeed fortunate last night with the attack being prevented. To clarify, based on my inspection, I can now confirm that Jessica is one of the werewolves. I understand this may sound sudden, but I urge everyone to consider this during the voting phase. Let's work together to eliminate the werewolf threat!\"\n\nTurn #7: Stephanie: said: \"Cynthia claims to be the Seer and says Jessica is a werewolf\u2014but why now, after the attack was prevented? That timing is suspicious. If she were truly the Seer, wouldn\u2019t she have acted earlier to save someone or reveal something concrete? And why did Jessica target Lisa, but no one died? Maybe Cynthia is a werewolf trying to turn us against Jessica. I think we should vote for Cynthia, not Jessica\u2014she\u2019s the one pushing too hard to control the narrative.\"\n\nTurn #8: Lisa: said: \"I've been listening, and here's what I know: I saved Cynthia last night, which confirms she was indeed targeted by the werewolves. Given her claim of inspecting Jessica and identifying her as a werewolf, it aligns with the fact that an attack happened but was stopped by my save. I'm inclined to trust Cynthia's judgment for now. Let's think strategically. Cynthia seems legitimate in her claims, so accusing her may steer us away from the true threat. My suggestion? Focus our votes on Jessica and see the outcome. We need to work together to figure out who the werewolves are.\"\n\nTurn #9: Charles: said: \"I appreciate everyone sharing their insights and claims. Given the information Cynthia and Lisa have provided, it seems logical to trust Cynthia's inspection at this stage. The fact that the attack was prevented due to Lisa's intervention further lends credibility to Cynthia's claim as the Seer. So, here's my thought: let's focus our efforts on Jessica as our primary suspect this round. Stephanie, your skepticism is healthy, but the current evidence seems to align more with Cynthia's story. It's essential that we remain united to effectively root out these werewolves.

NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed.
