WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed.

(2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public.

WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone.

Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed.

Let\u2019s pay close attention to who\u2019s trying to steer the conversation or acting too defensive.\"\n\nTurn #7: Amy: said: \"Good morning everyone. I don't know who the werewolves are yet, but I'm willing to work with everyone to figure this out. Let's share what we saw or suspect during the night\u2014I'm open to hearing all perspectives.\"\n\nTurn #8: Elizabeth: said: \"Thanks, Brian, for sharing your inspection. If Michael is truly a Villager, that narrows things down. But I\u2019m curious\u2014why did you choose to inspect Michael specifically? And since no one died last night, does that mean the Witch saved someone? Or maybe the Werewolves didn\u2019t act? Let\u2019s stay alert and watch for inconsistencies in everyone\u2019s stories.\"\n\nTurn #9: Jeffrey: said: \"Thanks, Brian, for confirming Michael is a Villager\u2014that\u2019s helpful. Elizabeth raises a good point about the lack of deaths: it could mean the Witch saved someone, or the Werewolves held back. I\u2019m suspicious of anyone who\u2019s overly eager to point fingers without evidence. Let\u2019s keep tracking who speaks up and who stays quiet\u2014consistency will reveal the truth.\"\n[Game] Entering state: Day_vote\n\nTurn #10: Michael: [action] vote Brian\nPatricia: [action] vote Alice\nBrian: [action] vote Elizabeth\nAmy: [action] vote name\nElizabeth: [action] vote Brian\nJeffrey: [action] vote Elizabeth\n[Game] Brian was voted out!\n[Game] Entering state: Night_werewolf\n\nTurn #11: [No recent activity]\n\nTurn #12: [Game] Entering state: Night_seer\n\nTurn #13: [Game] Entering state: Night_witch\n\nTurn #14: [Game] Entering state: Day_discussion\n\nTurn #15: Michael: said: \"Brian was voted out, and I believe that was the right call\u2014he claimed to have inspected me, but we all know only the Seer can do that. Since no one else has claimed to be the Seer, and Brian\u2019s inspection was suspiciously convenient, I think he might have been a Werewolf trying to manipulate us. Elizabeth and Jeffrey are both pointing fingers at each other\u2014let\u2019s hear from them directly before making another move. I\u2019m still trusting the group to stay honest and logical.\"\n\nTurn #16: Patricia: said: \"I'm still trusting the group to stay honest and logical.\"\n\nTurn #17: Amy: said: \"Thank you, I'm going to focus on the conversation.  I will continue to analyze and watch for inconsistencies.\"\n\nTurn #18: Elizabeth: said: \"Michael, your belief that Brian was a Werewolf because he claimed to be the Seer makes sense\u2014but remember, if Brian was lying about inspecting you, that doesn\u2019t necessarily make him a Werewolf. He could\u2019ve been bluffing to protect himself or mislead us. Since no one died last night, the Witch either didn\u2019t act or saved someone. I\u2019m still unsure who to trust. Jeffrey and I are both being targeted, but that might mean we\u2019re both seen as threats\u2014perhaps because we\u2019re asking the right questions. Let\u2019s not rush to eliminate someone based on suspicion alone. Who else has a reason to be silent? Patricia and Amy haven\u2019t contributed much beyond reassurances\u2014why is that?\"\n\nTurn #19: Jeffrey: said: \"Elizabeth, I appreciate your caution\u2014but Brian\u2019s claim to be the Seer was the only specific claim made so far, and it turned out to be false. That\u2019s not just bluffing; it\u2019s a dangerous deception that fits the Werewolf pattern. You and I are both being targeted, yes, but that\u2019s because we\u2019re the only ones asking hard questions\u2014and in this game, truth-tellers often become targets. Patricia and Amy haven\u2019t contributed because they might be Villagers waiting to see who emerges as a threat, or they could be Werewolves staying quiet to avoid suspicion. Let\u2019s not assume silence is innocence. I suggest we focus on who benefits from Brian\u2019s elimination: if the Werewolves wanted to remove a potential Seer, they\u2019d want him gone. But Brian was the only one claiming Seer power\u2014so if he\u2019s dead, who\u2019s left to verify anyone? That leaves us vulnerable. I\u2019m still trusting the group, but we need more than reassurances\u2014we need evidence.\"\n[Game] Entering state: Day_vote\n\n\nYour available action type(s): [action].\nIt is voting time.
