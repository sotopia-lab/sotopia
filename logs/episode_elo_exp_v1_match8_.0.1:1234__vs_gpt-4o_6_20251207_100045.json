GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed.

(2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Nicholas, Lisa, Cynthia, Karen, Scott, Jacob, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Cynthia's) goal: Discreetly inspect players at night to uncover werewolves.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf.

As the Witch, I indeed chose to save myself last night, which means the Werewolves targeted me. This suggests they might have seen me as a threat or were just making a calculated guess. With the save potion used up, the stakes are higher now for us Villagers, and we need to prioritize figuring out who among us could be aligned with the Werewolves. I have no additional information from inspecting, but I encourage everyone to consider last night's events and any ongoing patterns.

From what I gather, the werewolves seem to have gone for a bold move targeting Scott, hoping that he wouldn't anticipate being attacked. With the save potion used, this leaves me to ponder that the werewolves might be trying to eliminate strong roles early. If Scott holds the Witch role, it narrows down the potential werewolf candidates to Lisa, Cynthia, and Karen.

This implies the Witch used their save potion, since there was an attack that didn't result in a death. This means we still have both werewolves among us, and the Witch is likely out of saves. It's crucial we use today's discussion to gather as many insights as we can. Cynthia, Karen, Scott, and Jacob, do any of you have suspicions or information from last night?\"\n\nTurn #5: Lisa: said: \"I don't have any information from last night, and I'm not aware of any save or poison action. Cynthia was targeted by Lisa, but I don't think that means much\u2014maybe she's just being cautious. I trust the group's discussion to figure out who the werewolves are. I'm not suspicious of anyone in particular.\"\n\nTurn #6: Cynthia: said: \"Based on my inspection last night, I learned that Nicholas is a Villager, not a Werewolf. Given that no one died thanks to the Witch's save, it's crucial we focus our attention on others in today's discussion. While the Witch may have used their only save, we still have a chance to identify a Werewolf today. Let's hear more from Scott and Jacob about their thoughts or any suspicions.\"\n\nTurn #7: Karen: said: \"I appreciate Cynthia's insight about Nicholas, but I want to clarify that I don't have any information from last night's inspection. I only know that Scott was targeted by me during the night. Since the Witch prevented the death, I believe the save was used \u2014 and that makes me suspicious of the Witch, as they have the power to save someone. However, I don't have enough evidence to point fingers. I'm open to hearing more from Jacob and Lisa, especially if there's any other information about who might be hiding in plain sight.\"\n\nTurn #8: Scott: said: \"It's interesting to hear Cynthia confirm Nicholas as a Villager, providing some clarity there. As the Witch, I indeed chose to save myself last night, which means the Werewolves targeted me. This suggests they might have seen me as a threat or were just making a calculated guess. With the save potion used up, the stakes are higher now for us Villagers, and we need to prioritize figuring out who among us could be aligned with the Werewolves. I have no additional information from inspecting, but I encourage everyone to consider last night's events and any ongoing patterns. Let's discuss calmly and try to identify any incongruities in stories or behavior.\"\n\nTurn #9: Jacob: said: \"I find it significant that Scott claims he was targeted and chose to save himself, which implies he's indeed the Witch. This aligns with Cynthia's confirmation of Nicholas being a Villager. From what I gather, the werewolves seem to have gone for a bold move targeting Scott, hoping that he wouldn't anticipate being attacked. With the save potion used, this leaves me to ponder that the werewolves might be trying to eliminate strong roles early. If Scott holds the Witch role, it narrows down the potential werewolf candidates to Lisa, Cynthia, and Karen. Since Cynthia provides information but the verification possibility will lie with the results of tonight's events, I am curious to hear more dimensions from Lisa and Karen and their thoughts about the ongoing situations.

WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed.
