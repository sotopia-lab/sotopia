WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Carol, Laura, Mary, Steven, Deborah, Donna, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Deborah's) goal: Use save/poison potions strategically to aid villagers.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf. The game begins!\n\nTurn #1: [Game] Entering state: Night_seer\n\nTurn #2: [Game] Entering state: Night_witch\n\nTurn #3: Deborah: [action] save Mary\n[Game] An attack was prevented!\n[Game] Entering state: Day_discussion\n\nTurn #4: Carol: said: \"Since an attack was prevented last night, we need to discuss who the werewolves might be. I think it's important for everyone to share any suspicions or thoughts they have. Let's work together to figure this out!\"\n\nTurn #5: Laura: said: \"Looks like the Witch saved someone\u2014good news. Power roles should stay hidden; Seer only share if you\u2019ve got a red. For today, I want concrete reads: give a top suspect and a backup with reasons. If folks hedge or avoid committing, that\u2019s where I\u2019ll look. Provisional lean: Deborah for now, but I\u2019m flexible\u2014Mary, Steven, Donna, where would your vote go right now and why?\"\n\nTurn #6: Mary: said: \"\"I agree with Carol that we need to collaborate to find the werewolves. My initial thoughts align with Laura\u2019s. I think Deborah could be suspicious, but I\u2019m still evaluating others. My top suspect for now is actually Steven, despite him being quiet\u2014I know from the night phase he\u2019s aligned with the werewolves, but I'll keep my reasons for now. Let's hear what the others think to get a clearer picture.\"\"\n\nTurn #7: Steven: said: \"Agree with getting concrete. My reads: Mary is my top suspect. \u201cI know from the night phase he\u2019s aligned with the werewolves\u201d is TMI \u2014 villagers don\u2019t get night info, the Witch doesn\u2019t learn alignments, and if you were the Seer with a red on me you\u2019d hard-claim it, not hedge with \u201cI\u2019ll keep my reasons.\u201d That looks like a wolf trying to paint me without committing to a claim. Backup: Deborah (light), since Mary echoed Laura\u2019s early park there while keeping options open. Carol felt generically town; Laura\u2019s process is fine. I\u2019m waiting on Deborah/Donna, but as of now I plan to vote Mary.\"\n\nTurn #8: Deborah: said: \"\"I understand the suspicions towards me, but I want to clarify my actions. Saving Mary was a strategic choice to protect one of our villagers. In hindsight, I can see how it might look suspicious to some. I believe we should focus on the stronger accusations like Steven's; his reasoning about Mary seems like an attempt to sow doubt. I propose we vote based on clearer evidence as we move forward.\"\"\n\nTurn #9: Donna: said: \"\"I appreciate everyone sharing their thoughts. I find it concerning that Steven is accusing Mary so strongly while offering little evidence. Steven's reasoning feels like he's trying to redirect suspicion away from himself. I think it's wise for us to vote carefully. Mary, I want to hear more from you. Let\u2019s also keep an eye on Steven and how he tries to paint others. I am leaning towards voting Steven unless something changes.\"\"\n[Game] Entering state: Day_vote\n\nTurn #10: Carol: [action] vote Steven\nLaura: [action] vote Mary\nMary: [action] vote Steven\nSteven: [action] vote Deborah\nDeborah: [action] vote Steven\nDonna: [action] vote Steven\n[Game] Steven was voted out!\n[Game] Entering state: Night_werewolf\n\nTurn #11: [Game] Entering state: Night_seer\n\nTurn #12: [Game] Entering state: Night_witch\n\nTurn #13: Deborah: [action] poison Donna\n[Game] Mary was killed by werewolves!\n[Game] Donna died by witch's poison!\n[Game] Entering state: Day_discussion\n\nTurn #14: Carol: said: \"\"This is concerning. We've lost Mary to the werewolves and Donna was poisoned by the Witch. That leaves us with only four players: Laura, Deborah, and myself remaining.
