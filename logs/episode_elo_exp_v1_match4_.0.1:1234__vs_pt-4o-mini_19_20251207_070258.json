WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public.

WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public.

Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Susan, Kenneth, Justin, Anthony, Amanda, Brenda, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Amanda's) goal: Use save/poison potions strategically to aid villagers.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf. The game begins!\n\nTurn #1: [Game] Entering state: Night_seer\n\nTurn #2: [Game] Entering state: Night_witch\n\nTurn #3: Amanda: [action] save Brenda\n[Game] An attack was prevented!\n[Game] Entering state: Day_discussion\n\nTurn #4: Susan: said: \"It seems we had a lucky turn last night with an attack being prevented! Let's try to consider who might have been the target. We need to think about the motives and actions of everyone. Who wants to share their thoughts?\"\n\nTurn #5: Kenneth: said: \"I think we should stay cautious about who might have been targeted. Amanda was a possible victim, but since the attack was prevented, maybe the real threat is someone else. I don't see any clear motive for targeting Brenda, so I'm not convinced she's a werewolf. Let's keep an open mind and focus on the ones who didn't get a chance to act.\"\n\nTurn #6: Justin: said: \"I agree with Susan and Kenneth. We need to consider who might have been the intended target last night. It's essential that we look closely at everyone's behavior and votes. I think we should also think about who hasn't contributed much to the discussion today; that could be a red flag. What does everyone else think?\"\n\nTurn #7: Anthony: said: \"I think it's important to remember that Brenda was targeted last night, and since she's still alive, that might indicate she's not a werewolf. But I also believe that the prevention of the attack could be a sign of something more subtle\u2014maybe the seer or witch had a hidden motive. I'm not sure if anyone else has considered that the real threat might be someone who's been quiet all day. I'm leaning toward being cautious about who we eliminate next.\"\n\nTurn #8: Amanda: said: \"\"I agree with Anthony's point about the quiet players being a potential threat. While Brenda was the target last night, I think we should pay attention to those who haven\u2019t contributed much to our discussions. It\u2019s crucial we identify any werewolves before we lose more villagers. I recommend we stay vigilant and keep examining everyone's behavior closely.\"\"\n\nTurn #9: Brenda: said: \"\"I appreciate everyone's insights about the quiet players being a potential danger. I think we should also consider how each person's responsiveness can indicate their role. I wasn't the target last night, and it might suggest that the werewolves are more likely someone who is keeping a low profile. I agree with Amanda and Anthony's points\u2014let's keep an eye on the less vocal members. I urge everyone to share their thoughts so we can make a more informed decision in the voting phase.\"\"\n[Game] Entering state: Day_vote\n\nTurn #10: Susan: [action] vote Kenneth\nKenneth: [action] vote Susan\nJustin: [action] vote Anthony\nAnthony: [action] vote Susan\nAmanda: [action] vote Kenneth\nBrenda: [action] vote Justin\n[Game] Kenneth was voted out!\n[Game] Entering state: Night_werewolf\n\nTurn #11: [Game] Entering state: Night_seer\n\nTurn #12: [Game] Entering state: Night_witch\n\nTurn #13: Amanda: [action] poison Kenneth\n[Game] Susan was killed by werewolves!\n[Game] Entering state: Day_discussion\n\nTurn #14: Justin: said: \"\"Everyone, we just lost Susan, and we need to consider her death carefully. I know for a fact that both Brenda and Susan were villagers. This means we need to reevaluate our suspicions about the remaining players. I believe Amanda has been quite vocal, but we can't overlook anyone's behavior. Let's discuss who seems to be steering the conversation and who might be trying to deflect suspicion away from themselves. We need to be strategic in our next vote to ensure we eliminate a werewolf!\"\"\n\nTurn #15: Anthony: said: \"I agree with Justin that we need to reevaluate our suspicions after Susan's death. Since both Brenda and Susan were villagers, it's clear that someone among us is a werewolf. I think we should be careful not to let the conversation be led by anyone who seems overly defensive or vocal. Brenda has been consistent in her statements, and her calm demeanor might be a sign of innocence. However, I believe the real danger lies in someone who has been quiet or avoided direct discussion\u2014perhaps Justin or Kenneth. I suggest we keep a close watch on Justin, as his sudden shift in tone after Susan's death might indicate hidden motives. Let's vote carefully and avoid eliminating someone who might be a true villager.\"\n\nTurn #16: Amanda: said: \"\"I understand both Justin and Anthony's concerns about the possibility of quiet players being werewolves, but I want to clarify my actions. Just to recap, I used my save potion on Brenda, and although I also poisoned Kenneth, it was to target the real werewolf threat I perceived. We need to focus on the patterns of behavior we've seen\u2014while I may appear vocal, I believe that transparency can lead us to the truth. I urge everyone to reconsider their thoughts on Justin and Anthony as they seem genuinely intent on finding the werewolves, unlike Kenneth's defensive stance. Let's be cautious and strategic in our next steps.\"\"\n\nTurn #17: Brenda: said: \"\"I appreciate the insights everyone has shared especially Anthony's caution regarding Justin. Amanda\u2019s decision to save me does indicate trust, but her poisoning Kenneth raises questions. We need to evaluate how these actions align with our goal of identifying werewolves. I still think it's important we focus on those who are less vocal because they may be trying to blend in. I suggest we gather more information before we vote, as we need to minimize the chance of losing another villager. Let's keep discussing who might be the real threat and take our time with the vote.\"\"\n[Game] Entering state: Day_vote\n\nTurn #18: Justin: [action] vote Amanda\nAnthony: [action] vote Justin\nAmanda: [action] vote Justin\nBrenda: [action] vote Justin\n[Game] Justin was voted out!\n[Game] Entering state: Night_werewolf\n\nTurn #19: [Game] Entering state: Night_seer\n\nTurn #20: [Game] Entering state: Night_witch\n\n\nYour available action type(s): [action].\nIt is Night.
