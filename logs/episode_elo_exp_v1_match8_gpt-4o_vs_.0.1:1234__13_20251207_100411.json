WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Eric, Paul, Kathleen, Pamela, Kenneth, Nancy, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Kenneth's) goal: Use save/poison potions strategically to aid villagers.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf.

I'm not sure who the werewolves are, but it's clear that someone among us is working to eliminate the innocent. I think we should focus on discussing the possible identities of the werewolves and look for inconsistencies in who might have been involved in the kill. Let's keep an open mind and use the discussion to find patterns or suspicious behavior.\"\n\nTurn #5: Paul: said: \"I agree with Eric. It's tough to pinpoint exactly who might be responsible, especially since everyone seems to have an alibi. Early this morning, I heard a suspicious rustling sound coming from where Kenneth usually sits. We need to be meticulous and strategic in our discussion. I'd like to hear more from everyone, especially from Pamela, since she often has good insight in these situations. Maybe she noticed something last night that could help us.\"\n\nTurn #6: Pamela: said: \"I agree, it's really confusing right now, especially since Kathleen was one of the people we were relying on. I didn't hear much last night, but I do think it's important to consider who would benefit the most from her being gone. That could lead us to a motive. Personally, I'm not sure what to make of the rustling near Kenneth, but we should hear from him to make sure it's not something unrelated. We need to gather all the information we have and think rationally about our decision without jumping to conclusions too quickly.\"\n\nTurn #7: Kenneth: said: \"I want to clarify something about the night's events. I used the save potion to protect Nancy, which means I believe she is an innocent villager. If Nancy were a werewolf, she would have been eliminated by the wolves, but she survived. This gives us a clue: the wolves likely did not target her. Given that Kathleen was killed, it's possible the wolves are trying to eliminate someone who might expose them. I suggest we keep a close eye on anyone who might have a strong motive or opportunity to harm others. Also, the rustling I heard near my seat might have been a red herring, but it's worth noting that such sounds could be used to create false suspicions. Let's stay focused on evidence and avoid making assumptions based on hearsay.\"\n\nTurn #8: Nancy: said: \"I appreciate Kenneth's insight about using the save potion to protect Nancy. That's a solid point \u2014 if Nancy were a werewolf, she would have been killed, and the wolves would have had no reason to spare her. This strengthens the idea that she is a villager and likely innocent. I also agree with the need to focus on evidence rather than hearsay.
