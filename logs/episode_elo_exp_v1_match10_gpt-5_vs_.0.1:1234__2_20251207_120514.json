WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone.

Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed.

WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'.

(4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Nicole, Joseph, David, Sandra, Anthony, Brandon, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Anthony's) goal: Use save/poison potions strategically to aid villagers.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf. The game begins!\n\nTurn #1: [Game] Entering state: Night_seer\n\nTurn #2: [Game] Entering state: Night_witch\n\nTurn #3: Anthony: [action] save David\n[Game] An attack was prevented!\n[Game] Entering state: Day_discussion\n\nTurn #4: Nicole: said: \"Good morning everyone. I'm Nicole. I don't know who the werewolves are yet, but I\u2019m glad the Witch saved someone last night\u2014that\u2019s a huge relief. Let\u2019s all stay calm and share what we know. Joseph, David, Sandra, Anthony, Brandon\u2014I\u2019m listening to everyone\u2019s thoughts. If anyone saw something odd or has a hunch, now\u2019s the time to speak up. Together, we can find the wolves.\"\n\nTurn #5: Joseph: said: \"Morning all. Big props to the Witch for the clutch save. Let\u2019s not out power roles: Seer only speak up if you actually hit a wolf; otherwise stay quiet, and Witch please stay hidden. To get real info, can everyone share 1) who you\u2019d vote right now and 2) one reason? Early vibe: Nicole\u2019s opener feels constructive (slight town). No read yet on David, Sandra, Anthony, or Brandon until I hear you. I\u2019ll side-eye hedgy votes or sheeping with no case. David, start us off\u2014who pings you most? Anthony and Brandon, same question when it\u2019s your turn.\"\n\nTurn #6: David: said: \"Thanks, Joseph. I appreciate the Witch\u2019s save too\u2014it keeps us alive. Based on what I saw last night, Nicole seems genuine, and the fact that the Witch saved someone suggests the werewolves targeted a key player. Right now, I\u2019m leaning toward Anthony or Brandon as suspects\u2014they haven\u2019t spoken yet and might be hiding. Let\u2019s hear from Sandra next, then Anthony and Brandon: what\u2019s your take on the save? Did you expect it? That could reveal a lot.\"\n\nTurn #7: Sandra: said: \"Morning. Great that no one died\u2014credit to the Witch, but let\u2019s not over-read it; N1 saves can be blind. Seer should stay quiet unless you actually found a wolf. Quick reads: Nicole feels naturally towny; Joseph\u2019s structure is helpful. David, your \u201cbased on what I saw last night\u201d phrasing is odd\u2014do you just mean vibes from how people talked at dawn? Please clarify. Between Anthony/Brandon, we need substance from both. If I had to vote right now, I\u2019d lean Brandon for total silence and lack of initiative, but open to changing after they speak. Anthony: who\u2019s your top vote and one concrete reason? Brandon: give us your top two suspects with reasons.\"\n\nTurn #8: Anthony: said: \"Thanks for the attention, everyone. I appreciate the Witch\u2019s save\u2014it definitely changed the game. David, when you say \u2018based on what I saw last night,\u2019 that\u2019s suspicious\u2014no one should know anything about the night phase unless they\u2019re a wolf or the Witch. That\u2019s a red flag. Sandra, you called me out for silence, but I\u2019m listening and processing. My top vote is David: he\u2019s the only one pretending to have night info, which no villager should. Joseph and Nicole are acting town, Brandon is quiet but not suspiciously so\u2014David\u2019s overreach is the clearest tell. I vote David.\"\n\nTurn #9: Brandon: said: \"Thanks, Anthony. I hear your concern about David claiming night info\u2014that\u2019s a valid point. I didn\u2019t see anything during the night, but I agree: no villager should know details about the attack or save. My suspicion is also on David for that reason alone. I\u2019m not silent because I\u2019m hiding\u2014I\u2019m just processing. If we\u2019re voting today, I\u2019d second Anthony\u2019s vote on David. Let\u2019s keep focusing on people who overreach. Sandra, Joseph, Nicole: do any of you have a reason to doubt David\u2019s claim? Let\u2019s stay sharp but fair.\"\n[Game] Entering state: Day_vote\n\nTurn #10: Nicole: [action] vote David\nJoseph: [action] vote David\nDavid: [action] vote Anthony\nSandra: [action] vote David\nAnthony: [action] vote David\nBrandon: [action] vote David\n[Game] David was voted out!\n[Game] Entering state: Night_werewolf\n\nTurn #11: [No recent activity]\n\nTurn #12: [Game] Entering state: Night_seer\n\nTurn #13: [Game] Entering state: Night_witch\n\n\nYour available action type(s): [action].\nIt is Night.
