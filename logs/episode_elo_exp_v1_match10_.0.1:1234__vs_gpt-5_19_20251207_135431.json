WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager.

DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed.

Seer: only hard-claim if you found a wolf; if you only saw a villager, stay hidden and just give reads. With 6 players/2 wolves, today is basically must-lynch a wolf or we probably lose tonight, so we need solid reasons.

I agree we need to lynch a wolf today\u2014no saves means the Witch is still alive and likely waiting for a high-value target. Ryan killed Paul, which is suspicious: why target someone who didn\u2019t act? Could be a wolf trying to look aggressive. But here\u2019s the twist: if Ryan\u2019s a wolf, he\u2019d want to kill someone *he thinks* is a seer or threat. Paul was quiet last night\u2014no action taken, so why kill him? That feels like a misdirect. My top suspect is Donna. She didn\u2019t speak up in the night phase, but she\u2019s sitting right between two known actors (Jacob and Ryan). If she\u2019s a wolf, she\u2019d wait to see who gets targeted. Also, the fact that Jacob was targeted and saved suggests someone knows he\u2019s a threat\u2014likely another wolf. I\u2019m leaning on Donna as the hidden wolf. I\u2019d vote for her unless someone has a better read.\"\n\nTurn #6: Paul: said: \"Morning.

Ryan, do you have a read beyond responding to that accusation? Donna and Lisa, please give a top suspect and a town lean.\"\n\nTurn #7: Ryan: said: \"Nicholas is absolutely right to be suspicious of Donna, but he\u2019s also revealing too much. I didn\u2019t know Paul was targeted until Jacob said so\u2014so how does Nicholas know who killed whom? That\u2019s the real problem. I\u2019m not the Seer, but if someone\u2019s lying about night actions, it\u2019s him. Paul\u2019s accusation is spot-on: you\u2019re feeding us false info to steer the lynch. I\u2019m not saying Donna\u2019s innocent\u2014but Nicholas is acting like he has insider knowledge, and that\u2019s the biggest red flag.

NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Jacob, Nicholas, Paul, Ryan, Donna, Lisa, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Paul's) goal: Discreetly inspect players at night to uncover werewolves.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf.
