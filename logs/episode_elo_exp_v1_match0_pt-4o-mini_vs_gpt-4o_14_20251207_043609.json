GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Karen, Kimberly, Jennifer, Linda, Donald, Melissa, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Jennifer's) goal: Discreetly inspect players at night to uncover werewolves.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf.

It's crucial that we share any insights we might have. Let's think about why a werewolf might have targeted that specific person and consider who would have been likely to take that action. If you're the Seer or the Witch and uncovered any useful information, please share anything that can help reveal the werewolves. We need to work together to protect the village.\"\n\nTurn #5: Kimberly: said: \"\"I agree, it's interesting that an attack was prevented. We should definitely analyze why that might have happened. It could indicate that we have a strong Witch among us. It\u2019s also possible that someone is trying to mislead us \u2013 could that be a sign of a Werewolf getting desperate?

I\u2019m really curious about what everyone else thinks, especially about who might actually be manipulating this situation.\"\"\n\nTurn #8: Donald: said: \"\"I appreciate everyone's input on what happened overnight. I'd like to highlight how crucial our roles are when it comes to making the right decisions. Seeing an attack was prevented, it implies that we have an active Witch in the village who's looking out for us. Without revealing too much, I believe we should thoroughly consider our past interactions and subtle hints given during discussions. Jennifer, while your suspicion of Linda might be valid, we should base our accusations on more than just gut feelings. I encourage everyone to consider the patterns and contradictions we've seen in people's stories. We need to collaborate effectively and thoughtfully if we're to uncover the Werewolves among us. Let's gather as much information as possible before deciding on a vote.\"\"\n\nTurn #9: Melissa: said: \"\"I agree with the caution advised by both Linda and Donald. While Jennifer\u2019s suspicion towards Linda could be noted, we should remember that deception is key in this game, and anyone can attempt to manipulate others for their benefit. I think it\u2019s important we hear from everyone, especially any roles that have pertinent knowledge to share without completely exposing themselves.

If you're the Seer or the Witch and uncovered any useful information, please share anything that can help reveal the werewolves. We need to work together to protect the village.\"\n\nTurn #5: Kimberly: said: \"\"I agree, it's interesting that an attack was prevented. We should definitely analyze why that might have happened. It could indicate that we have a strong Witch among us. It\u2019s also possible that someone is trying to mislead us \u2013 could that be a sign of a Werewolf getting desperate? I think we should be cautious in our discussions and maybe focus on the interactions we've had throughout the game.

We should use this day phase to carefully analyze everything that happened. From my perspective, Linda has been acting quite suspicious lately. I think it\u2019s possible she was involved in last night's events. Of course, I suggest we take a closer look at Linda for any potential connections she might have with the werewolves.

Yes, I was acting a bit differently, but that doesn't mean I am a werewolf. Remember, the game is designed to create suspicion. I ask everyone to think about the evidence rather than personal biases. Let's focus on the patterns of behavior that we can observe instead of making accusations without cause. I\u2019m really curious about what everyone else thinks, especially about who might actually be manipulating this situation.\"\"\n\nTurn #8: Donald: said: \"\"I appreciate everyone's input on what happened overnight. I'd like to highlight how crucial our roles are when it comes to making the right decisions. Seeing an attack was prevented, it implies that we have an active Witch in the village who's looking out for us. Without revealing too much, I believe we should thoroughly consider our past interactions and subtle hints given during discussions. Jennifer, while your suspicion of Linda might be valid, we should base our accusations on more than just gut feelings. I encourage everyone to consider the patterns and contradictions we've seen in people's stories. We need to collaborate effectively and thoughtfully if we're to uncover the Werewolves among us. Let's gather as much information as possible before deciding on a vote.\"\"\n\nTurn #9: Melissa: said: \"\"I agree with the caution advised by both Linda and Donald. While Jennifer\u2019s suspicion towards Linda could be noted, we should remember that deception is key in this game, and anyone can attempt to manipulate others for their benefit. I think it\u2019s important we hear from everyone, especially any roles that have pertinent knowledge to share without completely exposing themselves.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public.
