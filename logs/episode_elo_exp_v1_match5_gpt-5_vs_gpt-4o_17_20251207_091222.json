WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'.

The saved attack last night is a fortunate start for us and signals the Witch might have already used their save, which means there's less room for error moving forward. I've taken note of the general suspicion around Carol's early suggestion to have the Seer reveal information, which could be seen as beneficial to werewolves. However, I want us to be cautious and not tunnel on them prematurely. For me, Jacob's consistency and desire to keep the discussion structured and based on specific reads offer a slight town lean. As for suspicions, Carol's move is raising some red flags. For voting, as it stands, I would lean towards Carol, but I remain open to hearing more insights.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Carol, Jacob, Daniel, Ryan, Joshua, Michelle, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Joshua's) goal: Use save/poison potions strategically to aid villagers.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf. The game begins!\n\nTurn #1: [Game] Entering state: Night_seer\n\nTurn #2: [Game] Entering state: Night_witch\n\nTurn #3: Joshua: [action] save Daniel\n[Game] An attack was prevented!\n[Game] Entering state: Day_discussion\n\nTurn #4: Carol: said: \"Good morning, everyone. It seems there was an attack last night, but thankfully it was prevented. We should consider who might have been targeted and speculate on why. If they were saved, they could be a high-value target. Also, our Seer might have useful information from the inspection last night. It's important we share what we all know and try to pinpoint any suspicious behavior from the start. Let's work together to uncover the werewolves among us. Your thoughts?\"\n\nTurn #5: Jacob: said: \"Wild night. The prevented kill likely means Witch used the save\u2014so no more saves left. Seer: only out if you have a werewolf; with just one peek, don\u2019t claim unless it\u2019s a red. If you do have a red, say it now. Carol, slight ping for nudging the Seer to share this early\u2014could be fishing, not a hard read. I want everyone to give one town lean and one suspect with reasons. Late slots often coast, so Joshua/Michelle, please be concrete. Daniel, who do you think benefits most from the save narrative today? Ryan, where would your vote go right now? Early pool: light suspicion on Carol; holding judgment on Joshua/Michelle until they speak.\"\n\nTurn #6: Daniel: said: \"Good morning everyone. Based on last night's events, it does seem logical to think the Witch used the save potion, so we might not have a second chance if a werewolf is on the verge of winning. Regarding who benefits from the save narrative today, I'm considering that it might make someone appear more trustworthy. My initial thought is to look closely at whether someone changes their behavior or tone - they might attempt to appear more helpful if they're actually guilty. Jacob, apart from Carol, do you have any other suspects based on last night's outcomes? Carol brought up a potential strategy, but I don't think it points to any definitive alignment just yet. Let's gather more thoughts on this and start connecting dots. I'm also interested to hear from Joshua and Michelle.\"\n\nTurn #7: Ryan: said: \"Morning. Prevented kill likely means Witch burned the save\u2014so don\u2019t expect another. Seer should only out on a red; no claim yet suggests a green peek, so keep scanning. Quick reads: slight town lean on Jacob for pushing structure and concrete stances (wolves tend to keep it mushy Day 1). Light sus on Carol\u2014your opener nudged the Seer to share and framed \u201chigh\u2011value target\u201d talk that doesn\u2019t help town today but does help wolves fish. Daniel feels pretty neutral/safe so far. Where I\u2019d vote right now: Carol, but I want Joshua and Michelle to weigh in before locking. Joshua, Michelle: give one town lean, one suspect, and where your vote would go this minute. Keep claims tight\u2014only red info should come out.\"\n\nTurn #8: Joshua: said: \"Hello everyone, it seems like we had an eventful night with the save. Given the situation, I agree that the Seer should hold off claiming unless there's a werewolf identified. When it comes to reads, Jacob\u2019s structured approach seems genuine, providing a slight town lean for him. Daniel gives off a neutral vibe, possibly because the save involved him, but I need more interactions to form a solid opinion. For suspicious behavior, I agree with the sentiment about Carol\u2014pushing the Seer to reveal early doesn't benefit us right now. If I had to choose right now, my vote would go towards Carol, but I'm open to hearing more before making a final decision.\"\n\nTurn #9: Michelle: said: \"Hello everyone. The saved attack last night is a fortunate start for us and signals the Witch might have already used their save, which means there's less room for error moving forward.
