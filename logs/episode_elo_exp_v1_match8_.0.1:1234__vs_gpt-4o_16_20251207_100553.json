WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager.

NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone.

Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed.

NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Elizabeth, Richard, Jacob, Amanda, David, Eric, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Richard's) goal: Deceive others, avoid detection, and eliminate villagers.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf.

It looks like we had some luck during the night since no one died. This could be due to the witch using the save potion or misfortune on the werewolves' side. We should focus on any suspicious behaviors from our last meeting and see if anyone wants to reveal any significant findings, like the Seer\u2019s inspection results. Let\u2019s be careful about our next move, as it might give us further clues on identifying the werewolves among us. \"\n\nTurn #5: Richard: said: \"Good morning everyone! I'm glad no one died tonight \u2014 it makes things a bit easier to keep our suspicions in check. I don't have any specific info from the Seer or Witch, but I do notice that Amanda was targeted by the werewolves, and Elizabeth was targeted by someone else. That might mean the wolves are trying to eliminate key players early. I'm not saying anyone is guilty, but I'd be cautious about anyone who seems to act out of place. Let's keep an open mind and focus on consistency in behavior.\"\n\nTurn #6: Jacob: said: \"Hello everyone. I'm relieved that no one was harmed last night but remember that we have to stay sharp. From my point of view, I think there's something quite unusual about Amanda's behavior. I can't reveal specifics, but I'd advise keeping a close eye on her during our discussions and decisions.

Amanda and Elizabeth were both targeted, which might suggest a coordinated effort, but I believe that's just part of the game's natural flow.

I'm grateful that nobody was harmed last night as well. As the discussion progresses, we should keep a couple of key things in mind: Firstly, the save could indicate the witch's protective intervention, which I believe was crucial yesterday. Secondly, given this close call, I'd suggest we remain alert. Keeping a watchful eye on any subtle behavioral changes could be beneficial. It's vital that we avoid rash judgments and use the opportunity to communicate openly. Let's pool whatever information we have and move forward with clarity and caution.\"\n\nTurn #9: Eric: said: \"Good morning everyone! It's fantastic that we're all still here, which gives us a moment to breathe and consider our next move carefully. Since both Amanda and Elizabeth were targeted, we might want to explore whether such patterns reveal anything about the werewolves' strategy or fears.\n\nI propose we have each person reexamine their initial impressions and speak up if they've noticed inconsistencies in someone's behavior from previous discussions. Staying vigilant and open to revisiting earlier decisions could help in narrowing down potential suspects.
