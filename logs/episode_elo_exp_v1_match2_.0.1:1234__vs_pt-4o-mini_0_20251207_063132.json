WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed.

NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone.

WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Kevin, Anthony, Jason, Jeffrey, Kathleen, William, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (William's) goal: Act openly and collaboratively to identify werewolves.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf. The game begins!\n\nTurn #1: [Game] Entering state: Night_seer\n\nTurn #2: [Game] Entering state: Night_witch\n\nTurn #3: [Game] Entering state: Day_discussion\n\nTurn #4: Kevin: said: \"Alright everyone, we made it through the night! Let's discuss who we think might be the werewolves among us. Does anyone have any suspicions or information to share?\"\n\nTurn #5: Anthony: said: \"Alright everyone, we made it through the night! Let's discuss who we think might be the werewolves among us. Does anyone have any suspicions or information to share?\"\n\nTurn #6: Jason: said: \"I believe we should consider who hasn't spoken much last round. Based on our discussions, I'd like to hear thoughts on who seems more suspicious. I've been watching behavior closely, and it feels like someone is hiding.\"\n\nTurn #7: Jeffrey: said: \"I've been watching behavior closely, and it feels like someone is hiding.\"\n\nTurn #8: Kathleen: said: \"I think it's important to consider who has been silent. Both Jason and Jeffrey have echoed similar sentiments without much input. We should focus on different perspectives to uncover any potential werewolves. Anyone else noticed this?\"\n\nTurn #9: William: said: \"I agree with Kathleen's point about how the quieter players might be hiding something. It's crucial for us to keep the conversation flowing so we can identify any suspicious behavior. I also noticed that Jason and Jeffrey both brought up similar thoughts about caution without giving us concrete examples. Let's all share specific observations or concerns to help us better identify potential werewolves.\"\n[Game] Entering state: Day_vote\n\nTurn #10: Kevin: [action] vote Jason\nAnthony: [action] vote Name\nJason: [action] vote Jeffrey\nJeffrey: [action] vote NAME\nKathleen: [action] vote Jason\nWilliam: [action] vote Jason\n[Game] Jason was voted out!\n[Game] Entering state: Night_werewolf\n\nTurn #11: [No recent activity]\n\nTurn #12: [Game] Entering state: Night_seer\n\nTurn #13: [Game] Entering state: Night_witch\n\nTurn #14: [Game] Entering state: Day_discussion\n\nTurn #15: Kevin: said: \"\"I believe we need to analyze the situation carefully after Jason's elimination. It's crucial that we share our observations about everyone's behavior and comments during the past discussions. I noticed that some players were more vocal about suspicion than others. I want to hear everyone's thoughts on the remaining players and if anyone has new insights or findings, especially after the night phases. Let's keep collaborating to unmask the werewolves!\"\"\n\nTurn #16: Anthony: said: \"Alright everyone, let's discuss who we think might be the werewolves among us. Does anyone have any suspicions or information to share?\"\n\nTurn #17: Jeffrey: said: \"Alright everyone, let's discuss who we think might be the werewolves among us. Does anyone have any suspicions or information to share?\"\n\nTurn #18: Kathleen: said: \"I think we need to reassess our suspicions. With Jason gone, we should look closely at those who were vocal about him being a werewolf. Kevin and William both pushed for his elimination quite strongly. How do you all feel about their claims? Let's discuss and see if we can identify any patterns in their behavior.\"\n\nTurn #19: William: said: \"I appreciate Kathleen bringing this up. It's important that we reflect on the voting dynamics. While I did support the claim against Jason, I did so based on a collective feeling of suspicion around him. However, I also recognize that we need to scrutinize our own actions and not just blame others.
