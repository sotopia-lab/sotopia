WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'.

If you only have a green, I still think you should claim and name the green to give us one confirmed town and a tighter pool.

NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed.

WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public.

Here\u2019s my plan to maximize info: Seer: If you have a red (wolf) result, please out it on your turn. If you only have a green, I still think you should claim and name the green to give us one confirmed town and a tighter pool. Witch: Please don\u2019t claim or say who you saved; keep poison for either a counterclaim situation or a high-confidence wolf, not a blind shot. Everyone: give your top two suspects, who you\u2019d vote right now, and why. Also say whether you agree with the seer-claims-even-with-green plan; if you oppose it, justify.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Laura, George, Kathleen, Gary, Brandon, Justin, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Laura's) goal: Act openly and collaboratively to identify werewolves.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf.

No death last night \u2014 likely a Witch save. That probably means no more save, so today is must-eliminate-a-wolf; a miss plus a night kill likely ends the game. Here\u2019s my plan to maximize info: Seer: If you have a red (wolf) result, please out it on your turn. If you only have a green, I still think you should claim and name the green to give us one confirmed town and a tighter pool. Witch: Please don\u2019t claim or say who you saved; keep poison for either a counterclaim situation or a high-confidence wolf, not a blind shot. Everyone: give your top two suspects, who you\u2019d vote right now, and why. Also say whether you agree with the seer-claims-even-with-green plan; if you oppose it, justify.

I\u2019m not the Seer, but I think your over-eagerness to assign roles is suspicious. You\u2019re trying to control the narrative, and now you\u2019re targeting Kathleen even though she\u2019s dead?

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Laura, George, Kathleen, Gary, Brandon, Justin, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Gary's) goal: Deceive others, avoid detection, and eliminate villagers.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf. The game begins!\nGeorge: [action] kill Kathleen\n\nTurn #1: Gary: [action] kill Laura\n[Game] Entering state: Night_seer\n\nTurn #2: [Game] Entering state: Night_witch\n\nTurn #3: [Game] An attack was prevented!\n[Game] Entering state: Day_discussion\n\nTurn #4: Laura: said: \"Good morning. No death last night \u2014 likely a Witch save. That probably means no more save, so today is must-eliminate-a-wolf; a miss plus a night kill likely ends the game. Here\u2019s my plan to maximize info: Seer: If you have a red (wolf) result, please out it on your turn. If you only have a green, I still think you should claim and name the green to give us one confirmed town and a tighter pool. Witch: Please don\u2019t claim or say who you saved; keep poison for either a counterclaim situation or a high-confidence wolf, not a blind shot. Everyone: give your top two suspects, who you\u2019d vote right now, and why. Also say whether you agree with the seer-claims-even-with-green plan; if you oppose it, justify. Directed questions: George \u2014 who looks partnered today, any early tonal pings? Kathleen \u2014 if no seer claim, where do you vote and what\u2019s your backup? Gary \u2014 are you comfortable voting on vibes today; if not, what info would change your mind? Brandon \u2014 among the five others, who feels agenda-driven vs. genuinely solving? Justin \u2014 if we get a seer red and a counterclaim, what\u2019s your tie-breaker (timing, vote history, tone)? Let\u2019s be decisive but careful; wolves win if we hand them today.\"\n\nTurn #5: George: said: \"Laura, you're putting a lot of pressure on the Seer to claim \u2014 that\u2019s exactly what a Wolf would do to create chaos and force false claims. I\u2019m not the Seer, but I think your over-eagerness to assign roles is suspicious. You\u2019re trying to control the narrative, and now you\u2019re targeting Kathleen even though she\u2019s dead? That feels like a Wolf trying to redirect attention. I\u2019m not voting today unless someone gives me real proof \u2014 and you haven\u2019t. Gary, you killed Laura? That\u2019s bold\u2026 but maybe too bold. I\u2019m watching both of you.\"\n\nTurn #6: Kathleen: said: \"Agree no-kill likely means Witch save is gone. That makes today must-eliminate-a-wolf. I do NOT support a seer claim with only a green today\u2014too easy for a wolf counterclaim to force a 50/50 that loses the game if we pick wrong. Only claim with a red, or to stop a mis-elim on your green if they\u2019re getting wagoned. \n\nIf no seer claim: I\u2019d vote George now. Reasons: he misstated the gamestate (I\u2019m clearly not dead), accused Gary of \u201ckilling Laura\u201d when Laura\u2019s alive, and said he won\u2019t vote on a must-elim day. That reads like wolfy chaos and reluctance to commit. Backup: tentatively Gary\u2014only if he refuses to engage or won\u2019t give names today; this is light and can change based on his response. \n\nTownlean: Laura\u2014structured plan and broad pressure; I see the risks but intent looks villagery. \n\nQuestions: \n- George: correct the \u201cKathleen is dead\u201d and \u201cGary killed Laura\u201d claims. Give your top two eliminations and why. Are you voting today, yes or no? \n- Gary: who are your top two right now, and will you commit to voting one? \n- Brandon: who feels agenda-driven vs. actually solving\u2014name two you\u2019d eliminate. \n- Justin: if two seer claims appear, what\u2019s your tie-breaker, and who are your top two before any claims?\n\nTL;DR: Don\u2019t force a green seer claim. Vote George; backup Gary pending his answers.\"\n\nTurn #7: Gary: said: \"I didn't kill Laura\u2014George is misremembering or lying. I'm just as confused as everyone else. Laura\u2019s analysis was solid, and George is deflecting by accusing her of being a wolf. That\u2019s textbook wolf behavior: create confusion, attack the most logical player to undermine structure. I\u2019m not seer or witch, so I don\u2019t have info\u2014but I\u2019m voting George today. He\u2019s the one who misstated Kathleen is dead, falsely claimed I killed Laura, and now refuses to commit to a vote on a must-elim day. That\u2019s not village logic\u2014it\u2019s wolf chaos. If no one else steps up with a claim, George is the only clear threat.\"\n\nTurn #8: Brandon: said: \"Agree this is must-elim. No-kill likely means a Witch save; assume we won\u2019t get that again. Seer should only claim with a red or to stop a mis-elim on your green\u2014green-only claim at 6p risks a losing 50/50. \n\nReads:\n- George = top wolf. He misstated that Kathleen is dead and that Gary killed Laura, refused to commit a vote on a must-elim, and is pushing paranoia on the most structured player. That\u2019s agenda/chaos over solving.\n- Justin = second. Zero content so far; possible partner with George. If George is a wolf, I don\u2019t see Gary/Kathleen as partners given their pushes; Laura less likely but not impossible; Justin fits best right now.\nTownleans: Kathleen (clear, practical stance), Laura (structured solving even if I disagree on green-claim), Gary (commits and gives reasons).\n\nPlan: Unless a seer red lands elsewhere, I intend to vote George. If George gives a coherent solve and commits to a vote, I\u2019ll reassess, but Justin needs to provide real reads and a vote today.\n\nQuestions:\n- George: correct your mistakes and give your top two; are you voting today\u2014who and why?\n- Justin: if no red claim, who\u2019s your elim and why? If George flips wolf, who\u2019s the partner?\"\n\nTurn #9: Justin: said: \"Catching up now. No-kill likely Witch save; treat today as must-eliminate. Seer policy: only claim with a red, or to stop a wagon on your green. A pure green claim at 6 risks a losing 50/50.\n\nTop suspects:\n1) George \u2014 multiple factual misreads (Kathleen \u201cdead,\u201d Gary \u201ckilled\u201d Laura), plus refusing to commit a vote on must-elim reads wolfy chaos over solving.
