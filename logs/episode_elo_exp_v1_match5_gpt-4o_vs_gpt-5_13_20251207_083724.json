GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act.

(2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Carol, Kimberly, Edward, Cynthia, Jacob, Shirley, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Edward's) goal: Discreetly inspect players at night to uncover werewolves.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf. The game begins!\n\nTurn #1: [Game] Entering state: Night_seer\n\nTurn #2: Edward: [action] inspect Jacob\n[Private to Edward] Jacob is on team: Villagers\n[Game] Entering state: Night_witch\n\nTurn #3: [Game] An attack was prevented!\n[Game] Entering state: Day_discussion\n\nTurn #4: Carol: said: \"Good morning. No one died\u2014likely a Witch save, so the save potion is probably gone. We should be careful with claims. Witch, please stay hidden. Seer should only reveal if you have a confirmed wolf; otherwise keep gathering info. For discussion: everyone name (1) your top suspect with a concrete reason and (2) one player you wouldn\u2019t vote today and why. Also say if you support forcing early claims (I\u2019m against it without a red). I\u2019ll hold my vote until I hear you, and I\u2019ll be wary of anyone rushing a quick execution or pushing unnecessary claims. Kimberly, who\u2019s your D1 push? Edward, if you had to elim right now, who and why? Cynthia, give us a townread. Jacob and Shirley, where do you stand on a seer claim today?\"\n\nTurn #5: Kimberly: said: \"Thank you, Carol. This seems like a good starting point for today's discussion. My D1 push would have to be on Shirley. I noticed she seemed a bit too intent on finding the Seer yesterday, which struck me as suspicious behavior. As for who I wouldn\u2019t vote for today, I\u2019d say Jacob. He\u2019s been consistently focused on fleshing out ideas and listening to others carefully. Lastly, I don\u2019t support forced early claims unless absolutely necessary; it just endangers our power roles.\"\n\nTurn #6: Edward: said: \"If I had to elim right now, I\u2019d go Shirley. Yesterday\u2019s focus on finding the Seer felt like PR-hunting instead of solving, which I don\u2019t like. I want to hear her response. I wouldn\u2019t vote Jacob today\u2014his questions have felt genuinely inquisitive and not angled toward forcing claims. I\u2019m against forcing early claims unless someone has a confirmed red. Also agree Witch should stay hidden. I\u2019d like to hear from Cynthia and Shirley before locking a vote.\"\n\nTurn #7: Cynthia: said: \"Thanks, Carol, Edward, and Kimberly for your input. Right now, my townread is also on Jacob. His participation has been consistent and he's been drawing out useful info from others without pushing for roles, which seems genuine. \n\nAs for who I wouldn't vote for today, I'd say Carol. Her guidance sets a methodical tone, allowing for measured discussion, which I believe is in town\u2019s best interest. Her focus on discernment without quick execution speaks volumes. I\u2019m also wary of pressing for claims without solid evidence\u2014a Seer reveal too soon could be detrimental. \n\nI'll hold back my vote until I hear from Shirley and others. Let\u2019s keep exchanging ideas and see if anyone slips.\"\n\nTurn #8: Jacob: said: \"Top suspect: Cynthia \u2014 she avoided naming a suspect, parked on safe townreads (me/Carol), and stayed non-committal while momentum formed on Shirley. That looks like hedging and keeping options open.\n\nWouldn\u2019t vote today: Edward \u2014 his push on Shirley is reasoned, he asked for her response before locking in, and his stance on claims aligns with a careful town mindset. Carol also leans town for process.\n\nSeer claim: Do not claim unless you have a red we can execute today.\n\nShirley: Please address the PR-hunting concern directly. What was your goal yesterday re: Seer? Give (1) your top wolfread with a concrete reason and (2) one player you wouldn\u2019t vote.\n\nKimberly/Edward: If Shirley\u2019s response is convincing, who\u2019s your next-best elim and why? I don\u2019t want us tunneled on a single wagon.\n\nCynthia: I need a firm suspect and why. Also, why is Carol specifically town beyond tone? Where would you vote if we had to place votes now?\n\nI\u2019ll wait for Shirley\u2019s response before locking a vote, but right now I\u2019m leaning Cynthia, then reassessing based on Shirley\u2019s answers.\"\n\nTurn #9: Shirley: said: \"Addressing the PR-hunting concern: Yesterday I pushed for setting claim protocol (don\u2019t claim Seer unless you have a red; Witch stay hidden) and watched reactions to see who would angle for early claims. That was not me trying to find the Seer. If my tone read like fishing, that\u2019s on me\u2014won\u2019t push claims today.\n\nReads:\n- Top suspect: Cynthia. She gave only safe townreads (Jacob/Carol), avoided naming a suspect, and parked on \u201cwaiting for Shirley\u201d while momentum built.

Edward leans town for asking for my response before locking and a consistent anti-claim stance.\n\nSeer claim today: Do not claim unless you have a confirmed red we can execute. With a prevented kill, the save is likely gone; a naked claim just gives wolves a target. Witch should stay hidden.\n\nWouldn\u2019t vote today: Jacob. If I had to place a vote right now, I\u2019d go Cynthia pending her giving a concrete suspect and stating where she\u2019d vote.
