WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed.

NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Jennifer, Christopher, Brenda, Margaret, Brandon, Anthony, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Margaret's) goal: Deceive others, avoid detection, and eliminate villagers.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf.

WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Jennifer, Christopher, Brenda, Margaret, Brandon, Anthony, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Christopher's) goal: Deceive others, avoid detection, and eliminate villagers.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf.

It looks like an attack was prevented last night, which means the Witch probably used their save potion. That means we have a bit more time to figure out who the werewolves are. I think it's important we all share any suspicions or observations, no matter how minor they might seem, to piece together the puzzle. Did anyone notice anything suspicious during the last discussion or have any gut feelings about who might be hiding something?\"\n\nTurn #5: Christopher: said: \"I'm not sure what happened last night, but I think we should stay cautious. The fact that an attack was prevented might mean the Witch saved someone, but it could also mean the Werewolves didn't act. I don't have any strong suspicions yet, but I'll keep an eye on who's acting oddly. If anyone else has thoughts, I'm all ears.\"\n\nTurn #6: Brenda: said: \"I agree with Jennifer that we need to focus on observations, even if they seem small. Last night was definitely unusual because the attack was somehow prevented. I had a chance to observe someone, and I can confirm that Jennifer is not a Werewolf. I trust her observations for now. We need to carefully consider who hasn't been contributing much to our discussions or who seems too quiet. They might be hiding something. Let's be vigilant.\"\n\nTurn #7: Margaret: said: \"I appreciate the discussion so far, and I agree that the prevented attack is a key point. Jennifer's statement about me being a Villager is actually a bit suspicious\u2014why would she suddenly say that if she wasn't sure? I think we should be cautious about trusting anyone who makes sudden claims about others. Also, I\u2019ve noticed that Brandon hasn\u2019t said much, and he\u2019s been quiet throughout the discussion. That might be worth keeping an eye on. I don\u2019t have any strong suspicions, but I\u2019ll be watching closely.\"\n\nTurn #8: Brandon: said: \"Thanks, everyone, for your insights. I know I've been pretty quiet, and I apologize for that. I wanted to take a moment to evaluate everyone\u2019s comments fully. From what I'm seeing, there's a lot of focus on those who point fingers or claim surety without evidence, like Margaret said. This is something we'll need to carefully consider as it could be a tactic to sway the group unnecessarily. With Brenda's confirmation about Jennifer, I think trusting her for now might be a wise choice. I\u2019m also now looking more closely at Anthony. He hasn\u2019t said anything yet, which is curious. It may be premature, but we should keep this in mind moving forward.\"\n\nTurn #9: Anthony: said: \"Hey everyone, sorry for not speaking up sooner\u2014I was taking everything in. I think it's crucial we balance our focus between those who seem overly accusatory and those who are too quiet. However, we also need to remember that silence alone isn't always an indication of guilt. As for me, I'm genuinely trying to piece together everything being said and looking for logical inconsistencies. \n\nIt\u2019s good that Brenda confirmed Jennifer isn\u2019t a Werewolf. This helps narrow down potential suspects. I suggest we remain methodical in our approach. Look for patterns in behavior and listen closely during discussions to spot any contradictions.
