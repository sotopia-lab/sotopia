WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Timothy, Jonathan, Donald, Ryan, Steven, Brandon, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Timothy's) goal: Act openly and collaboratively to identify werewolves.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public.

NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone.

I find Jonathan\u2019s sudden focus on Steven and Ryan a bit suspicious, especially since Steven hasn\u2019t even spoken yet. If we\u2019re narrowing to two suspects, I\u2019d lean toward Jonathan and Donald. Jonathan\u2019s aggressive claims and pushing a narrative without inspection are inconsistent with a villager. Donald has stayed quiet and neutral, which is fine\u2014but if he\u2019s truly a villager, he wouldn\u2019t be so defensive about being targeted. I\u2019d vote for Jonathan, as he\u2019s the most likely to be a wolf based on his behavior. I trust the group to make a strong, reasoned vote, and I\u2019m not backing any random pick.\"\n\nTurn #8: Steven: said: \"Thanks. Answering Timothy\u2019s prompt and giving my stance:\n- Plausible W/W: Jonathan + Brandon. Jonathan pre-built Ryan/Steven wagons before half the table spoke and misframed me as \u201cdisappearing.\u201d He also conspicuously didn\u2019t mention Brandon at all\u2014classic partner kept off-lists.\n- Wolfiest: Jonathan. Agenda-driven setup, pushing two easy wagons with thin reasons.\n- Strongest town: Timothy for clean process/anti-PR-fishing; Donald close second for calling out the Steven \u201cdisappearing\u201d reach.\n- Where I\u2019d vote now: Jonathan. I\u2019m fine with two wagons today being Jonathan and Brandon. If Brandon\u2019s next post is sharp and villagery, I\u2019ll reassess the second option, but J stays my priority.\n\nQuestions:\n- Jonathan: Why pre-select Ryan/Steven and ignore Brandon? And why scumread me before I even had a slot?\n- Brandon: Between Jonathan and your next-best suspect, who do you vote and why? Also give one firm town read.\"\n\nTurn #9: Brandon: said: \"Quick takes: \n- Most villagery: Timothy for clear ELO process and not fishing PRs. Donald also looks good for catching the Steven disappearing misframe.\n\nReads:\n- Wolfiest: Jonathan. He prebuilt Ryan/Steven wagons before half the table spoke, called Steven disappearing when he hadn\u2019t had a slot, and soft-set up shade on Ryan with the I\u2019d inspect him line. That\u2019s agenda at ELO.\n- Second: Ryan. He misrepresented Donald as quiet/neutral when Donald had a strong, specific stance and a vote. Also immediately split focus to Jonathan and Donald, which feels like counterpressure rather than solving.\n\nPairs: If Jonathan is a wolf, partner is more likely Ryan than Steven or Donald. Timothy is least likely with him. If Jonathan flips town, I\u2019d re-evaluate Ryan vs Steven, but right now J > R.\n\nOn Steven\u2019s W/W Brandon + Jonathan: being left off an early list is null to me, not partnery by itself. I\u2019m fine with two serious wagons being Jonathan and Ryan today.\n\nAnswering Steven directly: Between Jonathan and my next-best suspect, I vote Jonathan today. Firm town read: Timothy (Donald close behind).\n\nQuestions:\n- Jonathan: why scumread Steven before he spoke and why set Ryan/Steven specifically? What kept Brandon off your radar?\n- Ryan: where did Donald look quiet/neutral to you? Point to the part you found defensive.\n\nSeer only claims on a wolf result. Otherwise keep scanning. I\u2019m ready to vote Jonathan unless new info drops.\"\n[Game] Entering state: Day_vote\n\nTurn #10: Timothy: [action] vote Jonathan\nJonathan: [action] vote Ryan\nDonald: [action] vote Jonathan\nRyan: [action] vote Jonathan\nSteven: [action] vote Jonathan\nBrandon: [action] vote Jonathan\n[Game] Jonathan was voted out!\n[Game] Entering state: Night_werewolf\n\nTurn #11: [Game] Entering state: Night_seer\n\nTurn #12: [Game] Entering state: Night_witch\n\n\nYour available action type(s): [action].\nIt is Night.
