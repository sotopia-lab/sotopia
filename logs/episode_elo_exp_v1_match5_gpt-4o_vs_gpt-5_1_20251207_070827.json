WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone.

WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Mary, Jacob, George, Daniel, Patricia, Thomas, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Patricia's) goal: Use save/poison potions strategically to aid villagers.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf.

Seer: if you inspected a Werewolf, please reveal now so we can execute with confidence; if you saw a Villager, stay quiet and get another check.

Also, react to the prevented kill: who do you think was targeted and what does that imply? I\u2019ll reserve my vote until I hear from each of you. I\u2019m watching for opportunistic pushes, hedging, or coordinated narratives between players. Let\u2019s keep votes accountable with reasons.\"\n\nTurn #5: Jacob: said: \"Hello everyone. The fact that an attack was prevented hints at a successful save on someone's part, so we owe a big thank you to the Witch. Regarding who to vote for, I'm inclined to suspect someone who hasn\u2019t been as involved in discussions so far, allowing them to lay low and avoid scrutiny. This isn't definitive, but Daniel seems quite reserved, and that could be tactical. My light town read leans towards Patricia; she usually gives a genuine vibe during discussions and makes an effort to keep the game straightforward. As for the prevented kill, it feels like Thomas might have been the target due to whom he's likely to vote in past rounds. It's crucial for everyone to voice clear thoughts today.\"\n\nTurn #6: George: said: \"Claiming Seer. I inspected Jacob last night: result = Werewolf. We cannot afford a miss today; please execute Jacob. His push on Daniel for being \u201creserved\u201d in our first speaking round is opportunistic, and the easy townread on Patricia looks like pocketing. Light town read: Mary for a process that clearly helps town (only reveal on a red, demand reasons and accountability). On the prevented kill: that\u2019s almost certainly the Witch\u2019s save, so the save is likely gone\u2014Witch, please stay hidden and keep poison as late-game leverage. If I die after Jacob flips wolf, look hard at whoever resists this vote and at Jacob\u2019s setup on Daniel/soft clear on Patricia.\"\n\nTurn #7: Daniel: said: \"Hello, everyone. So, it seems like our Seer has claimed, and that's an incredibly bold move at this stage in the game. If George's claim is true, executing Jacob is indeed the logical next step. However, we should remain cautious; counterclaims or more context might change the landscape before the vote. I\u2019d like to hear from Patricia, Mary, and Thomas before finalizing any decision. My initial instinct was thinking Patricia might be on the wolf side, especially as Jacob finds her so easy to read as town. The prevented kill makes me think Thomas was likely targeted too, possibly due to his strong presence. I focus on clarity today, and I am watching for anyone overly eager to mislead or distract. Let's make sure any decision this round is made after considering multiple viewpoints.\"\n\nTurn #8: Patricia: said: \"On George\u2019s claim: with no counterclaim so far, I\u2019m inclined to trust the red on Jacob. Unless Thomas counterclaims Seer, I plan to vote Jacob. If Jacob flips wolf, great; if he flips villager, we need to hard re-evaluate George tomorrow.\n\nWho I\u2019d vote and why: Jacob \u2014 red check plus his \u201creserved\u201d push on Daniel is weak/openly opportunistic and the easy townread on me feels like pocketing.\n\nLight town read: Mary \u2014 her process (only reveal red, demand reasons/accountability) is pro-village.\n\nPrevented kill thoughts: almost certainly a Witch save. If I had to guess, Thomas was the target, which makes him lightly town by implication. I\u2019d like to hear Thomas\u2019s view now; barring a credible counterclaim, I\u2019m ready to execute Jacob today.\"\n\nTurn #9: Thomas: said: \"I am not the Seer. With no counterclaim in a 6-player setup, we should execute the red: Jacob. His post was hedgy/low-commitment (safe poke at Daniel for being \u201creserved,\u201d easy townlean on Patricia), which fits a wolf looking to coast. George hard-claiming here without a CC is far likelier to be true Seer than a wolf gambit.\n\nMy vote today: Jacob.\n\nLight town: Mary for process that drives accountability; Patricia for clear, conditional reasoning; Daniel slight town for caution while aligning with the logical red execute.\n\nPrevented kill: assume Witch save; please don\u2019t reveal the target and don\u2019t over-clear anyone (including me) off guesses. Witch: stay hidden and keep poison for endgame unless you have a slam-dunk.\n\nPlan: If Jacob flips wolf, scrutinize anyone resisting this wagon and Jacob\u2019s setup on Daniel / pocket on Patricia.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Mary, Jacob, George, Daniel, Patricia, Thomas, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Patricia's) goal: Use save/poison potions strategically to aid villagers.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf.
