GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed.

WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'.

WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act.

Robert, who\u2019s your vote and why? Jessica, same. Shirley, who do you trust most and least? Sandra, what kill choice do you think wolves made and why? Kenneth, give your top two suspects.

I think the wolves might have targeted Sandra, possibly to eliminate a strong villager, but I believe Shirley\u2019s move to kill Sandra was a distraction. Since no one died, it\u2019s likely the witch saved someone, and the seer didn\u2019t reveal a wolf. I suspect Jessica is a wolf because she was targeted by Robert and has no strong town support. I\u2019d vote for Jessica because she seems out of place and has been isolated. I\u2019m not backing anyone blindly\u2014this is a tight game, and I\u2019ll trust the group\u2019s judgment if they see a pattern.\"\n\nTurn #6: Jessica: said: \"Claiming now because it\u2019s execution-or-lose: I am the Seer.

Robert\u2019s post also reads wolfy: he invents a \u201cShirley move\u201d that hasn\u2019t happened, sprinkles speculation, then parks a weak push on me. Town read: Elizabeth for clear, pro-village structure and correct claim guidance. No-kill is almost certainly the witch save; witch please stay hidden. My vote today will be Robert.\"\n\nTurn #7: Shirley: said: \"I trust Elizabeth and Kenneth the most. I believe the wolves might have targeted Kenneth last night, as he's been unusually vocal and has shown signs of inconsistency in his claims. Sandra was a strong candidate for a wolf kill, but since she was targeted by Shirley and no one died, it\u2019s likely the witch saved her. I don\u2019t think Jessica is a wolf\u2014she\u2019s acting too aggressively and making a false claim about being the Seer. Robert\u2019s claim about me making a 'Shirley move' is absurd; I didn\u2019t kill anyone, and I have no reason to suspect myself. I\u2019d vote for Robert because he\u2019s the only one who claims to have seen a wolf and is now making a strong accusation. But if the real Seer is someone else, I\u2019ll follow the group\u2019s judgment. I\u2019m not backing a blind move\u2014this is a tight game, and I\u2019ll trust the discussion.\"\n\nTurn #8: Sandra: said: \"Town read: Jessica. In execution-or-lose, an immediate Seer claim with a specific red on Robert is the right play; no counter so far. Wolf read: Robert. His post invents a \u201cShirley move,\u201d contradicts itself about targets, pushes an isolated player, and hedges with \u201cI\u2019ll trust the group,\u201d which reads agenda-driven. Shirley\u2019s take also misstates facts (calling Jessica\u2019s claim false while saying she isn\u2019t a wolf, and saying Robert is the one claiming to have seen a wolf). That pings as potential partner or at least my second suspect. Kill guess: wolves likely shot into a high-impact slot like Jessica/Elizabeth; given the save, I\u2019d bet it was Jessica.

My second suspect is Shirley: her take misstates facts (calling Jessica not a wolf but also saying her Seer claim is false, and weirdly saying Robert is the one claiming to have seen a wolf). That combo reads like partner equity with Robert. The no-kill is almost certainly a witch save; if the save was on Jessica, it further supports her claim.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Elizabeth, Robert, Jessica, Shirley, Sandra, Kenneth, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Sandra's) goal: Use save/poison potions strategically to aid villagers.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf.
