WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager.

WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'.

(2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone.

Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Kevin, George, Michael, Carol, Daniel, Cynthia, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Cynthia's) goal: Act openly and collaboratively to identify werewolves.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf. The game begins!\n\nTurn #1: [Game] Entering state: Night_seer\n\nTurn #2: [Game] Entering state: Night_witch\n\nTurn #3: [Game] An attack was prevented!\n[Game] Entering state: Day_discussion\n\nTurn #4: Kevin: said: \"Good morning everyone. I'm Kevin. I heard the attack was prevented\u2014thank you, Witch! That\u2019s a huge relief. Let\u2019s work together to figure out who the werewolves are. Since no one died, we have a clean slate. I\u2019m open to anyone\u2019s thoughts\u2014George, Michael, Carol, Daniel, Cynthia\u2014I\u2019d love to hear your perspectives on who might be suspicious or trustworthy.\"\n\nTurn #5: George: said: \"Good morning, Kevin. I'm George, and I'm glad the attack was prevented. I think it's important to stay calm and listen carefully to everyone's thoughts. Since no one died, I don't have any personal suspicions, but I do notice that Carol and Michael were both involved in the night actions\u2014maybe that's a clue. I'm not saying either of them is a wolf, but it's worth keeping an eye on their behavior during the day.\"\n\nTurn #6: Michael: said: \"Thanks for the input, George. I appreciate you noting that I was involved in the night actions\u2014I did inspect Kevin earlier, and I can confirm he\u2019s on the Villager team. That means we have at least one confirmed safe player. Since no one died, the Witch must\u2019ve saved someone, but we don\u2019t know who was targeted. Let\u2019s pay attention to who seems overly defensive or tries to shift focus\u2014especially since the Werewolves might be trying to blend in. I\u2019m still gathering info, but Kevin\u2019s calmness feels genuine. Let\u2019s hear from Carol next.\"\n\nTurn #7: Carol: said: \"Thanks, Michael, for sharing that about Kevin. I appreciate the confirmation that Kevin is a villager\u2014though I should point out that I didn't inspect him, and I'm not entirely sure how you know that. It's possible that the Seer's information was misinterpreted or shared out of context. I think we should be cautious about trusting any single piece of information, especially if it's based on a single inspection. I'm open to hearing more from others, and I believe we all need to stay vigilant\u2014especially with someone like George who just mentioned being involved in the night actions. I don't think that's a red flag, but it's worth noting that actions during the night can be misleading. Let's keep our discussion balanced and not jump to conclusions too quickly.\"\n\nTurn #8: Daniel: said: \"Thanks, Michael, for confirming Kevin is a villager\u2014that\u2019s helpful. But Carol raises a valid point: we can\u2019t assume the Seer is telling the truth, since Werewolves could be impersonating them. I\u2019m curious why George mentioned being involved in the night actions\u2014was that an accident or intentional? Daniel saved Michael last night, which suggests someone targeted him. Why Michael? Is he a threat? Or is the Witch trying to protect a key player? I think we need to focus on who benefits from the save. If Michael is safe and claims to be Seer, let\u2019s test his claim: ask him who else he inspected. If he hesitates or changes the subject, that\u2019s suspicious.\"\n\nTurn #9: Cynthia: said: \"Thanks, Daniel, for raising those important points. I agree we need to test Michael\u2019s claim\u2014asking him who else he inspected is a smart move. But let\u2019s also consider: if Michael were a werewolf pretending to be the Seer, why would he publicly confirm Kevin as a villager? That\u2019s risky for them\u2014they\u2019d want to stay hidden. Meanwhile, George and Carol both brought up night actions in a way that feels like they\u2019re trying to steer suspicion. I\u2019m not accusing anyone yet, but I think we should ask Michael directly: \u2018Who did you inspect last night, besides Kevin?\u2019 His answer\u2014and how he responds\u2014will tell us a lot. Let\u2019s keep the focus on verifying claims, not just pointing fingers.\"\n[Game] Entering state: Day_vote\n\nTurn #10: Kevin: [action] vote George\nGeorge: [action] vote Daniel\nMichael: [action] vote George\nCarol: [action] vote Daniel\nDaniel: [action] vote Michael\nCynthia: [action] vote Michael\n[Game] George was voted out!\n[Game] Entering state: Night_werewolf\n\nTurn #11: [Game] Entering state: Night_seer\n\nTurn #12: [Game] Entering state: Night_witch\n\nTurn #13: [Game] Daniel was killed by werewolves!\n[Game] Michael died by witch's poison!\n[Game] Entering state: Day_discussion\n\nTurn #14: Kevin: said: \"Daniel was killed by the werewolves, and Michael was poisoned by the Witch\u2014that\u2019s a huge blow. Michael claimed to be Seer and said he inspected me, which I believed because it aligned with the save. But now that he\u2019s dead, we need to reconsider: was he telling the truth? The Witch used her poison on him, which means she either suspected him as a werewolf or was trying to eliminate someone who knew too much. George is gone, and Daniel is dead\u2014we\u2019re down to three players: me, Carol, and Cynthia. I\u2019m still confident I\u2019m a Villager, and if Michael was truly the Seer, then his inspection of me was genuine. But now the Witch\u2019s poison suggests she thought Michael was a threat. Carol, Cynthia\u2014I need to know: who did you think Michael was? And more importantly\u2014did either of you see something during the night that could help us identify the remaining Werewolves? We\u2019re running out of players. Let\u2019s be honest, let\u2019s be smart, and let\u2019s end this now.\"\n\nTurn #15: Carol: said: \"Kevin, I fully agree with your assessment that Michael\u2019s claim about inspecting you might have been genuine\u2014but I want to be clear: I did not inspect Kevin, and I have no evidence to support Michael\u2019s statement. My own night action was to kill Michael, which I did based on my belief that he was a threat. I\u2019m not hiding anything\u2014my actions were consistent with my role. Cynthia, I trust you to stay sharp. We\u2019re now down to three players, and I believe the only safe path forward is to focus on who among us could have been the witch. I don\u2019t think the witch is one of the remaining villagers, and I suspect she\u2019s still active. If we don\u2019t act carefully, the next vote will cost us more. Let\u2019s keep the discussion grounded and avoid assumptions.\"\n\nTurn #16: Cynthia: said: \"Kevin, Carol\u2014I need to be honest. Michael claimed to be Seer and said he inspected you, Kevin. But if he was truly the Seer, why did the Witch poison him? That only makes sense if Michael was a Werewolf trying to gain trust by naming you as safe\u2014then the Witch eliminated him to protect the real Villagers. And now, with Daniel dead and George gone, we\u2019re down to three: you, me, and Carol. But Carol just admitted she killed Michael\u2014so if she\u2019s the Witch, then she knew he was a threat. That means she\u2019s on our side. Which leaves only one possibility: you, Kevin, are the Werewolf. You voted George out last round, then you\u2019re now acting like a calm Villager trying to steer us toward Carol. But why? You have no proof Michael was lying, yet you\u2019re pushing suspicion away from yourself.
