GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Charles, Angela, Sharon, Anna, Emma, Richard, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Emma's) goal: Use save/poison potions strategically to aid villagers.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf.

That means the witch likely used their save potion on someone. We should discuss who they might have saved and gather insights on who could potentially be the werewolves. Who do you all suspect?\"\n\nTurn #5: Angela: said: \"Attack prevented is good for us, but we shouldn\u2019t speculate on who was saved\u2014 that only helps wolves narrow the Witch/target. Witch stay quiet; Seer only reveal if you found a wolf. Early read: Charles steering us to talk about the save feels like subtle fishing, which pings me. I want to hear Sharon and Emma next, but right now Charles is my top suspect.\"\n\nTurn #6: Sharon: said: \"I agree with Angela that discussing who the Witch might have saved could potentially help the Werewolves. Let's focus on our suspicions instead. As for my thoughts, I found Charles's eagerness to discuss the saved player a bit suspicious. We need to be cautious about revealing too much.\"\n\nTurn #7: Anna: said: \"Agree we shouldn\u2019t speculate on who was saved\u2014that just narrows targets for wolves. Charles, why lead with that? What info did you expect to gain that wasn\u2019t basically fishing for Witch/target? That pings me. I also don\u2019t love how fast Sharon echoed without adding much. Right now my order is Charles > Sharon, but I\u2019m open. Emma and Richard, please give your top two suspects and where you\u2019d vote. Seer only out if you have a wolf; Witch stay quiet. Unless there\u2019s a solid explanation from Charles or new info, I\u2019m leaning to vote Charles.\"\n\nTurn #8: Emma: said: \"\"I agree with the concerns raised about discussing who was saved. It\u2019s a risky move that could backfire on us. My top suspects right now are Charles, for the reasons already mentioned, and Sharon, who seemed to jump on Charles's comment without much justification. I think we should gather more input before making any decisions. Let\u2019s be careful to not reveal too much that could help the werewolves.\"\"\n\nTurn #9: Richard: said: \"\"I agree with the concerns raised about discussing who the Witch might have saved.
