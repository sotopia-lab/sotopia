WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed.

WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act.

Karen, you\u2019re up\u2014if you\u2019re Seer, claim; if not, who are your top two and why?\"\n\nTurn #5: Karen: said: \"I'm not the Seer, but I think Andrew is suspicious\u2014he was the first to act in Night phase and immediately targeted Donald without any context. That\u2019s too aggressive for a Villager; it feels like he's trying to create chaos or cover for the Wolves. Also, Karen killed Shirley last night\u2014that\u2019s a weird move if she were innocent. My top two suspects: Andrew and Karen. I\u2019d vote Andrew first.\"\n\nTurn #6: Nicole: said: \"Claiming now: I\u2019m the Seer. Last night I inspected Andrew \u2014 result is Werewolf. Today is must-eliminate; please execute Andrew. If someone else is the Seer, counterclaim now; otherwise treat this as a red. Also, note Karen\u2019s claim about seeing night actions is impossible and looks like partner cover, but focus Andrew first.\"\n\nTurn #7: Andrew: said: \"Nicole claims to be Seer and says I\u2019m a Werewolf? That\u2019s convenient\u2014she\u2019s the only one who could\u2019ve seen my night action, but she didn\u2019t inspect anyone else. Karen killed Shirley, and now Nicole jumps in with a red on me? That\u2019s too fast. Why didn\u2019t she inspect Karen or Donald? I\u2019m not the Seer, but if Nicole is lying, she\u2019s either a Werewolf trying to eliminate me before I can expose her\u2014or the Witch trying to mislead. Either way, she\u2019s suspicious. My top suspect is Nicole: her claim is too clean, no hesitation, and she ignored Karen\u2019s suspicious kill. Vote Nicole.\"\n\nTurn #8: Donald: said: \"Agree this is must-eliminate. Nicole\u2019s Seer claim with a red on Andrew is our only solid info; absent a counterclaim we should execute Andrew. Andrew\u2019s defense misstates roles (Seer checks alignment; Witch doesn\u2019t inspect), which is scummy. Also, Karen\u2019s talk about seeing night actions and \u201cKaren killed Shirley\u201d is impossible and reads like wolfy noise\u2014if Andrew flips wolf, I\u2019d look at Karen next. If any real Seer counterclaims Nicole, do it now; otherwise I\u2019m voting Andrew.\"\n\nTurn #9: Timothy: said: \"Must-eliminate agreed. With no counterclaim, we should treat Nicole\u2019s Seer red on Andrew as real and execute Andrew. Andrew\u2019s defense confuses Seer/Witch mechanics and tries to undercut the only hard info. Also, Karen\u2019s \u201csaw night actions / Karen killed Shirley\u201d is impossible and reads wolfy\u2014if Andrew flips wolf, I\u2019d look at Karen next. Donald feels town for pushing correct process.
