GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed.

If he\u2019s trying to flush out the Witch by killing someone obvious, that\u2019s classic wolf behavior. Donna, you\u2019re my top trust for now\u2014you didn\u2019t act out of fear or agenda. James and Helen, I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts before I vote, but right now I\u2019m leaning toward Thomas. Seer, if you saw anything useful, now\u2019s the time to step up.\"\n\nTurn #6: Donna: said: \"Claiming Seer: I inspected Joseph last night\u2014result: Werewolf. I\u2019m voting Joseph today. His \u201cdangerous for us wolves\u201d slip plus the push on Thomas fits. Tentative trust: Thomas (being pushed by my red check) and a mild townlean on Jennifer for structured, pro-village prompts. If anyone counterclaims Seer, say so now; otherwise let\u2019s execute Joseph.\"\n\nTurn #7: Thomas: said: \"Donna just claimed Seer and says she inspected Joseph as a Werewolf. That\u2019s convenient\u2014she\u2019s the only one who didn\u2019t get targeted last night, and now she\u2019s making a bold claim with no proof. Joseph was the first to accuse me, but Donna\u2019s timing is too perfect: she survives, then immediately claims Seer and points at the only person who acted against her. That\u2019s a wolf move\u2014eliminating the accuser and framing Joseph to redirect attention. I\u2019m voting Donna. She\u2019s either a wolf or a reckless villager who just handed the wolves an easy win by overplaying. If she\u2019s telling the truth, why didn\u2019t she save Jennifer? Why wait until now? Trust no one who claims Seer without evidence\u2014especially when it benefits them.\"\n\nTurn #8: James: said: \"Right now I\u2019d vote Joseph. Reasons: (1) Donna\u2019s red check with no counterclaim so far is strong in a 6-player setup; a Seer hitting a wolf D1 is exactly what we need. (2) Joseph\u2019s \u201cdangerous for us wolves\u201d slip plus his case on Thomas reads like wolf perspective\u2014he talks about Thomas \u201ckilling\u201d Donna, which isn\u2019t how villagers think about Night actions. (3) Pushing Thomas right after a claimed red on Joseph looks like deflection. Tentative trust: Donna for the claim; mild townlean on Jennifer for structured, pro-village prompts; slight townlean on Thomas due to the opportunistic push against him. Helen, where are you at?

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Jennifer, Joseph, Donna, Thomas, James, Helen, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (James's) goal: Use save/poison potions strategically to aid villagers.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf.

Witch, please stay hidden unless you can out a wolf today. Seer: if you saw a wolf last night, please claim and name them; if you only saw a villager, consider staying quiet for now. For discussion, let\u2019s get concrete: everyone say (1) who you\u2019d vote right now and why, and (2) one player you\u2019d tentatively trust and why. Vague platitudes help wolves. Joseph, who\u2019s your top suspect and what\u2019s your vote? Donna, who feels most agenda-driven? Thomas, give us a firm read with reasons. James, pick one person you\u2019d clear for now. Helen, same prompt. I\u2019ll reserve my vote until I hear you all, but I\u2019ll suspect anyone who avoids making a real commitment today.\"\n\nTurn #5: Joseph: said: \"Jennifer, thanks for setting the tone. I agree\u2014no death means a Witch save, and that\u2019s dangerous for us wolves because it keeps the villagers alive.
