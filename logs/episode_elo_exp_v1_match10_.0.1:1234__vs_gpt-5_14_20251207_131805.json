WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Emily, Barbara, Jacob, Thomas, Nicholas, Deborah, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Nicholas's) goal: Use save/poison potions strategically to aid villagers.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf. The game begins!\n\nTurn #1: [Game] Entering state: Night_seer\n\nTurn #2: [Game] Entering state: Night_witch\n\nTurn #3: Nicholas: [action] save Jacob\n[Game] An attack was prevented!\n[Game] Entering state: Day_discussion\n\nTurn #4: Emily: said: \"Morning all\u2014no death means the Witch saved. That makes today LYLO: if we execute a villager, wolves likely win tonight, so be precise. Seer: only speak up if you have a wolf (red) and name it; otherwise stay quiet. Witch: please don\u2019t reveal. For your single post, please include: (1) if you are the Seer with a red (only if yes), (2) your top suspect with a brief reason and a backup, and (3) who you\u2019re willing to vote. I\u2019ll hold my vote until I hear everyone. Early note: anyone fishing for who was saved or pushing a mass-claim pings me. Jacob and Thomas, I especially want clear stances from you both.\"\n\nTurn #5: Barbara: said: \"Emily, I hear you\u2014no death means the Witch saved, and that\u2019s a big deal. But let\u2019s not overthink it: Thomas and Jacob both targeted someone last night, which is suspicious. Thomas killed Jacob? That\u2019s odd\u2014if he\u2019s a wolf, why kill his own? Or if he\u2019s a villager, why target Jacob without knowing who the wolves are? Jacob was killed, but Thomas chose to kill him\u2014so either Thomas is a wolf trying to frame someone, or Jacob was the wolf and Thomas was trying to protect us. Either way, Thomas is acting weirdly aggressive. I\u2019m suspicious of him. My top suspect: Thomas. Backup: Deborah, because she\u2019s silent and that\u2019s suspicious too. I\u2019m voting Thomas.\"\n\nTurn #6: Jacob: said: \"Agree with Emily: this is LYLO; keep claims tight and only out a red. Barbara, your post is impossible and contradictory. There was no death, yet you said \u201cJacob was killed\u201d and that Thomas killed me. Also, no town role learns \u201cwho targeted whom\u201d at night. That reads like fabricated info to push a mis-exe on Thomas. Top suspect: Barbara. Backup: pending Thomas\u2019s statement; if nothing compelling, Deborah for low-signal. Willing to vote: Barbara. I am not voting Nicholas today.\"\n\nTurn #7: Thomas: said: \"Barbara, you\u2019re misrepresenting the game. No one knows who targeted whom at night\u2014that\u2019s secret info. You\u2019re fishing to frame me by pretending you have inside knowledge. Jacob and I both acted, but that\u2019s normal for wolves targeting villagers or villagers reacting to suspicion. You\u2019re the one pushing a narrative without evidence. I\u2019m not the wolf\u2014I\u2019m trying to flush out the real threat. My top suspect: Barbara. She\u2019s fabricating facts to shift blame. Backup: Deborah, because she hasn\u2019t spoken at all\u2014silent players are often wolves hiding. I\u2019m voting Barbara.\"\n\nTurn #8: Nicholas: said: \"Agree it\u2019s LYLO. Top suspect: Barbara \u2014 her post claims impossible night info (\u201cThomas targeted/killed Jacob\u201d) and contradicts the no-kill, which reads like a fabricated push. Backup: Deborah for zero content; need a clear stance and vote options from her. Willing to vote: Barbara. I\u2019m not voting Jacob today.
