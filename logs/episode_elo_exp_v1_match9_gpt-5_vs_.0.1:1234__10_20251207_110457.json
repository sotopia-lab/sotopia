WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Pamela, Deborah, Scott, Timothy, Ashley, Nicole, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Nicole's) goal: Act openly and collaboratively to identify werewolves.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf. The game begins!\n\nTurn #1: [Game] Entering state: Night_seer\n\nTurn #2: [Game] Entering state: Night_witch\n\nTurn #3: [Game] Scott was killed by werewolves!\n[Game] Entering state: Day_discussion\n\nTurn #4: Pamela: said: \"I think someone is a werewolf. I'm suspicious of Deborah.\"\n\nTurn #5: Deborah: said: \"Whoa, Pamela\u2014on what basis are you calling me out? We\u2019ve got nothing but Scott\u2019s death and you\u2019re jumping straight to me with no reason. That looks like a wolf trying to start an easy mislynch. I\u2019m not a werewolf. Give us your case. Timothy, Ashley, Nicole\u2014who are your top suspects and why? If Pamela can\u2019t back this up, I\u2019m fine voting her today.\"\n\nTurn #6: Timothy: said: \"Pamela, that\u2019s a pretty naked push\u2014why Deborah specifically? With no reasoning, it looks like trying to set up an easy miselim. Deborah\u2019s response reads like a pressured townie asking for cases and reads, which I actually like. Right now I\u2019m leaning Pamela. Ashley, Nicole\u2014who are your top suspects and why? If Pamela can\u2019t back this up with something concrete, I\u2019m fine voting there today.\"\n\nTurn #7: Ashley: said: \"I'm leaning Pamela. I'm suspicious of Deborah.\"\n\nTurn #8: Nicole: said: \"I've got a strong suspicion that someone is a werewolf. I\u2019m suspicious of Deborah.\"\n[Game] Entering state: Day_vote\n\n\nYour available action type(s): [action].\nIt is voting time. You MUST use the command 'vote NAME' to vote for a player to eliminate. e.g. 'vote Alice'\n\nPlease only generate a JSON string including the action type and the argument.\nYour action should follow the given format:\n{\"properties\": {\"action_type\": {\"const\": \"action\", \"description\": \"whether to speak at this turn or choose to not do anything\", \"title\": \"Action Type\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"argument\": {\"description\": \"the utterance if choose to speak, the expression or gesture if choose non-verbal communication, or the physical action if choose action\", \"title\": \"Argument\", \"type\": \"string\"}}, \"required\": [\"action_type\", \"argument\"], \"title\": \"AgentAction\", \"type\": \"object\"}"
