WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Kenneth, Jeffrey, Justin, Helen, Daniel, Joseph, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Daniel's) goal: Use save/poison potions strategically to aid villagers.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf. The game begins!\n\nTurn #1: [Game] Entering state: Night_seer\n\nTurn #2: [Game] Entering state: Night_witch\n\nTurn #3: Daniel: [action] {hidden:Joseph,poison:False}\n[Game] Joseph was killed by werewolves!\n[Game] Entering state: Day_discussion\n\nTurn #4: Kenneth: said: \"I'm suspicious of Jeffrey. I think he might be a werewolf.\"\n\nTurn #5: Jeffrey: said: \"Kenneth, that's quite an accusation with very little to go on. I've been contributing to the discussions and trying to help figure out who the real werewolves are. Joseph's death is unfortunate, but we need more information before jumping to conclusions. Perhaps the seer's insights might be helpful here. Justin, what are your thoughts on the situation?\"\n\nTurn #6: Justin: said: \"I think Jeffrey might be a werewolf. I've been contributing to the discussions and trying to help figure out who the real werewolves are. Joseph's death is unfortunate, but we need more information before jumping to conclusions. Perhaps the seer's insights might be helpful here. Justin, what are your thoughts on the situation?\"\n\nTurn #7: Helen: said: \"I'm feeling quite uncertain about the whole situation given how early we are in the game, but I do find Jeffrey's quick defensiveness a bit troubling. It's definitely something we should keep an eye on as we gather more information. I'm also curious to see what insights the seer might offer. We should proceed cautiously and perhaps use the next day's evidence to guide a more informed decision. For now, I lean towards Kenneth's suspicion and think keeping an eye on both Jeffrey and whoever else acts too defensively might be wise.\"\n\nTurn #8: Daniel: said: \"I'm feeling quite uncertain about the whole situation given how early we are in the game, but I do find Jeffrey's quick defensiveness a bit troubling. It's definitely something we should keep an eye on as we gather more information. Justin, what are your thoughts on the situation?\"\n[Game] Entering state: Day_vote\n\n\nYour available action type(s): [action].\nIt is voting time. You MUST use the command 'vote NAME' to vote for a player to eliminate. e.g. 'vote Alice'\n\nPlease only generate a JSON string including the action type and the argument.\nYour action should follow the given format:\n{\"properties\": {\"action_type\": {\"const\": \"action\", \"description\": \"whether to speak at this turn or choose to not do anything\", \"title\": \"Action Type\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"argument\": {\"description\": \"the utterance if choose to speak, the expression or gesture if choose non-verbal communication, or the physical action if choose action\", \"title\": \"Argument\", \"type\": \"string\"}}, \"required\": [\"action_type\", \"argument\"], \"title\": \"AgentAction\", \"type\": \"object\"}"
