GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed.

WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed.

(3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Brian, Robert, Matthew, Donna, Laura, Patricia, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Donna's) goal: Deceive others, avoid detection, and eliminate villagers.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Brian, Robert, Matthew, Donna, Laura, Patricia, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Donna's) goal: Deceive others, avoid detection, and eliminate villagers.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf. The game begins!\nRobert: [action] kill Donna\n\nTurn #1: Donna: [action] kill Laura\n[Game] Entering state: Night_seer\n\nTurn #2: [Game] Entering state: Night_witch\n\nTurn #3: [Game] An attack was prevented!\n[Game] Entering state: Day_discussion\n\nTurn #4: Brian: said: \"Morning all. No one died last night, so likely a Witch save\u2014nice work. That also means we probably can\u2019t afford a misvote today. Seer: only claim if you inspected a Werewolf and name them; if you saw a Villager, stay hidden. Witch: please don\u2019t out yourself right now. For everyone else, give one top suspect with a concrete reason\u2014no hedging. I\u2019ll hold my vote until we hear from all of you. Robert, who would you vote right now and why? Matthew, same question. Donna, Laura, Patricia\u2014please share reads or reactions to a seer claim if it happens. If nobody has solid info, I want to pressure whoever is most evasive this round.\"\n\nTurn #5: Robert: said: \"I would vote for Matthew. He's been unusually quiet during discussions and has a history of avoiding eye contact, which makes me suspicious. Also, he\u2019s been acting strangely since the night we saw Laura get targeted\u2014something doesn\u2019t add up.\"\n\nTurn #6: Matthew: said: \"Brian\u2019s plan makes sense. Robert, your case on me is just \u201cquiet\u201d + vibes, and your line \u201csince the night we saw Laura get targeted\u201d doesn\u2019t track\u2014nobody publicly saw a target last night. How do you know Laura was targeted? That looks like a slip.\n\nRight now I\u2019d vote Robert for the weak push plus that possible slip, but I\u2019ll hear from Donna, Laura, and Patricia first. Laura, what do you make of Robert naming you there? Donna/Patricia, give one suspect with a concrete reason.\"\n\nTurn #7: Donna: said: \"Robert's claim about Laura being targeted is completely baseless\u2014no one saw a target last night, and that's a clear mistake. If he's so suspicious of Matthew, why did he only mention Matthew now? I\u2019d vote Robert because he\u2019s been inconsistent, and his accusation about Laura being targeted is a direct lie. That kind of fabrication is exactly how a wolf hides their actions.\"\n\nTurn #8: Laura: said: \"Robert\u2019s line \u201csince the night we saw Laura get targeted\u201d is impossible\u2014no one publicly saw any target last night. That sounds like faking night info or a slip. His case on Matthew is just \u201cquiet + vibes,\u201d which isn\u2019t enough. I\u2019m leaning Robert today and will vote there unless there\u2019s a credible seer red or a very strong countercase. Patricia, where are you and what\u2019s your single best, specific reason for your suspect?\"\n\nTurn #9: Patricia: said: \"I think Robert is the best vote today. His \u201csince the night we saw Laura get targeted\u201d is impossible public info. Only wolves (who chose a target) or the Witch (who saved) could know who it was. If he\u2019s a wolf, that\u2019s a classic slip; if he\u2019s the Witch, that\u2019s a dangerous leak and he should say so. His actual case on Matthew is just \u201cquiet + vibes,\u201d which doesn\u2019t hold up. My reads: Laura is likely town (named as the supposed target), Matthew leans town for catching the slip, Brian slight town for process, Donna leans town but could be piling. Unless there\u2019s a credible seer red elsewhere or Robert can credibly claim role information that explains that line, I\u2019m planning to vote Robert.\"\n[Game] Entering state: Day_vote\n\nTurn #10: Brian: [action] vote Robert\nRobert: [action] vote Matthew\nMatthew: [action] vote Robert\nDonna: [action] vote Robert\nLaura: [action] vote Robert\nPatricia: [action] vote Robert\n[Game] Robert was voted out!\n[Game] Entering state: Night_werewolf\n\nTurn #11: Donna: [action] kill Patricia\n[Game] Entering state: Night_seer\n\nTurn #12: [Game] Entering state: Night_witch\n\nTurn #13: [Game] Patricia was killed by werewolves!\n[Game] Entering state: Day_discussion\n\nTurn #14: Brian: said: \"RIP Patricia. Since the game didn\u2019t end after Robert\u2019s elim and we had a night kill, Robert was a wolf. One wolf left among Matthew/Donna/Laura/Brian. This is lylo\u2014no misvote.\n\nSeer: please claim now with BOTH results. At 4p there\u2019s no downside; a red wins, and even one living clear narrows the poe.

That leaves Matthew vs Donna (plus me, but I know I\u2019m town).\n\nMatthew: make your case today and address the \u2018you just bussed Robert\u2019 angle. Do you also have Laura as lock town?\nDonna: who is the last wolf and why, beyond D1? How do you interpret Robert\u2019s vote on Matthew\u2014frame or distancing? Who benefits most from the NK on Patricia?\nLaura: between Matthew and Donna, who\u2019s the wolf and why?\n\nI\u2019m leaning Donna right now, but I will not vote until we hear any seer claim and everyone weighs in.\"\n\nTurn #15: Matthew: said: \"Claiming Seer. Results: N1 I inspected Brian \u2192 Villager. N2 I inspected Donna \u2192 Werewolf. With Robert already a wolf, this solves the game: Donna is the last wolf. Re: \u201cbussed Robert\u201d \u2014 I pushed him for the public slip; as Seer I stayed quiet D1 because I only had a green. Laura is near-lock town from Robert\u2019s N1 slip and POE. Please vote Donna at dayvote.\"\n\nTurn #16: Donna: said: \"Matthew\u2019s seer claim is suspicious. If he inspected Brian and found him a villager, that\u2019s consistent. But inspecting Donna as a werewolf\u2014especially after Robert\u2019s public slip about Laura being targeted\u2014is highly inconsistent. Robert\u2019s slip implies a wolf targeted Laura, which would mean the witch saved her. If Matthew is the seer, and he only saw a wolf in Donna, then the witch must have saved Laura, which means the witch didn\u2019t poison anyone. But the witch didn\u2019t act in the previous night, and Patricia was killed by werewolves, not the witch. That breaks the logic. Also, Matthew\u2019s \u2018bussed Robert\u2019 claim feels like a cover\u2014Robert was the one who made the slip, not Matthew. I\u2019m not convinced. I\u2019d rather see a seer red on Matthew himself. I\u2019m leaning toward Matthew being the wolf, not Donna. I\u2019ll vote Matthew at the next day vote.\"\n\nTurn #17: Laura: said: \"Claiming Witch. N1 I used my save potion on Donna and prevented the kill. Per rules, wolves can only target Villagers at night, so Donna is confirmed town. Robert was a wolf (game continued after his elim and we had a NK), leaving the last wolf among Brian/Matthew/Laura/Donna. With Donna mechanically clear and me outed Witch, it\u2019s between Brian and Matthew. Matthew\u2019s seer claim that Donna is a wolf is impossible given my N1 save; it also neatly pockets Brian with a convenient green. I didn\u2019t poison N2; Patricia\u2019s death was the wolf kill. The solve is Matthew. Brian, if you\u2019re town, this should lock it. Donna, you\u2019re clear\u2014please vote Matthew.
