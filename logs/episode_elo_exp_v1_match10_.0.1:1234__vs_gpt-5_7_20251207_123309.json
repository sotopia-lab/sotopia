GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed.

NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act.

NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Amanda, Daniel, Sharon, Barbara, Brandon, Anthony, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Brandon's) goal: Use save/poison potions strategically to aid villagers.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf. The game begins!\n\nTurn #1: [Game] Entering state: Night_seer\n\nTurn #2: [Game] Entering state: Night_witch\n\nTurn #3: Brandon: [action] save Amanda\n[Game] An attack was prevented!\n[Game] Entering state: Day_discussion\n\nTurn #4: Amanda: said: \"No kill last night\u2014likely a Witch save. Witch please stay hidden; Seer should only speak up if you saw a Werewolf, otherwise stay quiet to get another check. For today, let\u2019s each give a top suspect and a concrete reason so we can build consensus rather than a random execution. I\u2019ll judge by logic and consistency, not volume. Daniel, start us off: who would you vote and why? Then Sharon, Barbara, Brandon, and Anthony\u2014same question. If we can\u2019t form a solid majority case, I\u2019d rather avoid a reckless elimination; if we can, I\u2019m ready to commit.\"\n\nTurn #5: Daniel: said: \"Amanda, thanks for setting the tone. I agree we need logic over panic. Last night, Sharon was killed\u2014but since the Witch saved someone, it\u2019s likely she saved *someone else*, meaning the kill was meant for her. That points to a Werewolf pair targeting strong players early. Barbara killed Amanda? That\u2019s odd\u2014why would a Werewolf kill their own teammate? Unless\u2026 Barbara is trying to appear innocent by pretending to be aggressive. I\u2019m suspicious of her. She\u2019s the first to act aggressively in the night, and now she\u2019s pushing chaos. I vote Barbara. She\u2019s too eager to point fingers; real villagers don\u2019t stab first and ask later.\"\n\nTurn #6: Sharon: said: \"I\u2019m the Seer. I inspected Daniel last night and he is a Werewolf. His message is also inconsistent (claiming I was killed, mixing names), which fits a caught wolf scrambling. I strongly recommend we vote Daniel today. If anyone counterclaims Seer, please state exactly whom you inspected and the result so we can compare. If Daniel doesn\u2019t flip wolf, you can eliminate me tomorrow; but he will. Witch, please stay hidden and conserve poison unless absolutely necessary.\"\n\nTurn #7: Barbara: said: \"Sharon claims to be the Seer and says she inspected Daniel\u2014but why would she reveal herself so early? That\u2019s a classic Werewolf tactic: fake the Seer to redirect suspicion. Daniel was targeted because he killed Sharon, and now she\u2019s using that to frame him. But if she were the real Seer, why didn\u2019t she save herself? And why would she risk exposing her role before the Witch even acted? I think Sharon is lying. She\u2019s trying to steal the narrative. Daniel might be guilty, but her story doesn\u2019t add up. I vote Sharon\u2014she\u2019s the one manipulating the conversation.\"\n\nTurn #8: Brandon: said: \"Two big red flags: (1) Daniel said \u201cSharon was killed\u201d when she\u2019s alive and we had a no-kill. That reads like a pre-scripted wolf narrative. (2) Barbara\u2019s push on Sharon misstates roles\u2014\u201cwhy didn\u2019t she save herself?\u201d Only the Witch can save; a Seer revealing on a red check is exactly when you do reveal. Sharon also offered to be eliminated tomorrow if Daniel doesn\u2019t flip, which adds credibility.\n\nGiven the hard claim + result, I\u2019m ready to vote Daniel unless there\u2019s a counterclaim with a specific inspection and result. If Daniel flips wolf, Barbara is my leading partner read from the immediate, logic-twisting defense.\n\nAnthony, where are you? Any world where Sharon is faking here? If not, let\u2019s consolidate on Daniel.\"\n\nTurn #9: Anthony: said: \"I\u2019m leaning strongly on Daniel today. Reasons: (1) Sharon hard-claims Seer with a red check and offers to be eliminated if wrong\u2014high-confidence, plus no counterclaim so far. (2) Daniel\u2019s post has major factual slips (\u201cSharon was killed,\u201d name mix-ups), which reads like a pre-baked wolf narrative assuming last night\u2019s kill went through before the save was revealed. (3) Barbara\u2019s push misstates roles (\u201cwhy didn\u2019t she save herself?\u201d), which only the Witch can do, and that defense feels like partner cover. Before we lock: if anyone counterclaims Seer, speak now with your target and result. Barring that, I will vote Daniel to avoid a split.
