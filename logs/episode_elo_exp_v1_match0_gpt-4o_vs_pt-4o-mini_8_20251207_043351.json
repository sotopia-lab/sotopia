GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Melissa, Larry, Emily, Justin, Ronald, George, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (George's) goal: Act openly and collaboratively to identify werewolves.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf.

It's so crucial that we vote wisely today. With two werewolves in our midst, we can't afford any more losses. I think it's strange how quiet Ronald was yesterday, and we haven't heard much from him. We need transparency here. Any thoughts on who we should focus on?\"\n\nTurn #5: Emily: said: \"\"I agree with Larry, we need to be very cautious. It's alarming that we lost Melissa. I think Ronald's quietness is indeed suspicious, but we should also consider Justin's actions. Did anyone notice how he reacted when Melissa was mentioned? It might be worth discussing further as we decide on our votes.\"\"\n\nTurn #6: Justin: said: \"Hey, I hear you both. It's devastating we've already lost Melissa. Look, I understand pointing fingers is part of weeding out the werewolves, but jumping to conclusions without evidence isn't going to help us. Ronald hasn't been vocal, sure, but maybe he was simply observing and gathering thoughts before speaking up. We need to work together, not against each other, so let\u2019s hear everyone's insights and decide rationally.\"\n\nTurn #7: Ronald: said: \"I understand the concern surrounding my silence, but I'd like to remind everyone that we have to think critically about our next steps.
