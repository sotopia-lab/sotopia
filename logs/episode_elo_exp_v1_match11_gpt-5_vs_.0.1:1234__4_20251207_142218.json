WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed.

NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone.

His opener was very safe and generic\u2014no specific claims, no red flags, no suspicion raised. That\u2019s unusual for a villager who\u2019s actively engaged in the game. It feels like a pattern that could belong to a wolf trying to avoid attention.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Paul, Margaret, Emily, Jason, Anna, Jonathan, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Margaret's) goal: Deceive others, avoid detection, and eliminate villagers.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Paul, Margaret, Emily, Jason, Anna, Jonathan, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Anna's) goal: Use save/poison potions strategically to aid villagers.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf.

I'm Paul, and I'm here to help us work together to identify the werewolves. Since we just had a night where an attack was prevented, I think it's important to stay calm and focus on discussion. I don't have any specific suspicions yet, but I'm open to hearing everyone's thoughts. Let's make sure we all share our observations and reasoning to find the truth together.\"\n\nTurn #5: Margaret: said: \"Wild night\u2014no kill likely means a Witch heal. Witch please don\u2019t reveal. Seer: only hard-claim if you hit a wolf; otherwise breadcrumb and live another night. Paul\u2019s opener is fine but very safe. I want specifics from everyone.

I\u2019d rather elim low-content than flip a coin. If anyone has a strong ping, bring it now\u2014we only get one round.\"\n\nTurn #6: Emily: said: \"My top two suspects are Jason and Jonathan. Jason was inspected last night and confirmed to be a werewolf, so I have strong evidence against him. As for Jonathan, he has been unusually quiet and didn\u2019t participate much in the discussion, which is suspicious. I would tentatively clear Anna\u2014she\u2019s been very open and consistent in her statements, and I don\u2019t see any red flags with her. I\u2019m confident that Jason is a werewolf, and I\u2019m wary of Jonathan as a possible second wolf.\"\n\nTurn #7: Jason: said: \"Emily\u2019s claim doesn\u2019t add up. Only the Seer would know an inspection result, yet she didn\u2019t hard-claim\u2014she said \u201cJason was inspected\u201d like secondhand info.

Also, scumreading Jonathan for being \u201cunusually quiet\u201d before he\u2019s even had his turn today is fabricated. And handing Anna a free townread looks like pocketing. This feels like a wolf pushing a cheap mis-exe. \n\nI\u2019m a Villager. My suspects: 1) Emily (for the fake/semi-claim and agenda), 2) Paul (very safe opener, no real stance). Jonathan is null until he speaks; Anna is null\u2014don\u2019t let Emily\u2019s free clear sway you.\n\nI will vote Emily today. Real Seer/Witch: stay quiet.

That makes her statement secondhand, which is a red flag. However, I don\u2019t believe she\u2019s lying outright; she might be trying to use a breadcrumb to guide discussion. I will not vote her out today. As for my suspicions, I believe Paul is a potential wolf because he opened with a very safe statement and didn\u2019t offer any specific claims or evidence. His opener is too clean to be a villager who\u2019s been actively involved in the game. I would tentatively clear Jason\u2014his claim that he was inspected and confirmed as a werewolf is not verifiable. I also believe Jonathan is a strong suspect due to his silence, but I will not vote him out yet. I vote for Paul today because of his lack of specificity and the pattern of safe openings.

I'm Paul, and I'm here to help us work together to identify the werewolves. Since we just had a night where an attack was prevented, I think it's important to stay calm and focus on discussion. I don't have any specific suspicions yet, but I'm open to hearing everyone's thoughts. Let's make sure we all share our observations and reasoning to find the truth together.\"\n\nTurn #5: Margaret: said: \"Wild night\u2014no kill likely means a Witch heal. Witch please don\u2019t reveal. Seer: only hard-claim if you hit a wolf; otherwise breadcrumb and live another night. Paul\u2019s opener is fine but very safe. I want specifics from everyone. Emily and Jason: who are your top two suspects right now and why? Anna and Jonathan (going later), please name one concrete suspect and one person you\u2019d tentatively clear; if we get hedging, I\u2019m comfortable voting in that pool today. I\u2019d rather elim low-content than flip a coin. If anyone has a strong ping, bring it now\u2014we only get one round.\"\n\nTurn #6: Emily: said: \"My top two suspects are Jason and Jonathan. Jason was inspected last night and confirmed to be a werewolf, so I have strong evidence against him. As for Jonathan, he has been unusually quiet and didn\u2019t participate much in the discussion, which is suspicious. I would tentatively clear Anna\u2014she\u2019s been very open and consistent in her statements, and I don\u2019t see any red flags with her. I\u2019m confident that Jason is a werewolf, and I\u2019m wary of Jonathan as a possible second wolf.\"\n\nTurn #7: Jason: said: \"Emily\u2019s claim doesn\u2019t add up. Only the Seer would know an inspection result, yet she didn\u2019t hard-claim\u2014she said \u201cJason was inspected\u201d like secondhand info.

Jonathan is null until he speaks; Anna is null\u2014don\u2019t let Emily\u2019s free clear sway you.\n\nI will vote Emily today. Real Seer/Witch: stay quiet. Let the flip speak.\"\n\nTurn #8: Anna: said: \"Jason, your claim about Emily not hard-claiming is valid\u2014only the Seer would know inspection results, and Emily did not state she was the Seer or that she inspected Jason. That makes her statement secondhand, which is a red flag. However, I don\u2019t believe she\u2019s lying outright; she might be trying to use a breadcrumb to guide discussion. I will not vote her out today. As for my suspicions, I believe Paul is a potential wolf because he opened with a very safe statement and didn\u2019t offer any specific claims or evidence. His opener is too clean to be a villager who\u2019s been actively involved in the game. I would tentatively clear Jason\u2014his claim that he was inspected and confirmed as a werewolf is not verifiable. I also believe Jonathan is a strong suspect due to his silence, but I will not vote him out yet. I vote for Paul today because of his lack of specificity and the pattern of safe openings. I stand by Anna as a safe, consistent player.\"\n\nTurn #9: Jonathan: said: \"Jason, thank you for your detailed and logical response. I appreciate your pointing out the flaw in Emily\u2019s claim about Jason being inspected\u2014only the Seer would know that, and she didn\u2019t hard-claim it, so that does make her statement secondhand, which is a valid red flag.

His opener was very safe and generic\u2014no specific claims, no red flags, no suspicion raised. That\u2019s unusual for a villager who\u2019s actively engaged in the game.

Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed.
