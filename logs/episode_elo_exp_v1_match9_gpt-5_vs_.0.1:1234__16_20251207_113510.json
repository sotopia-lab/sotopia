GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act.

NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Kenneth, Margaret, Brenda, Joshua, Kathleen, Ronald, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Ronald's) goal: Act openly and collaboratively to identify werewolves.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf. The game begins!\n\nTurn #1: [Game] Entering state: Night_seer\n\nTurn #2: [Game] Entering state: Night_witch\n\nTurn #3: [Game] Kenneth was killed by werewolves!\n[Game] Entering state: Day_discussion\n\nTurn #4: Margaret: said: \"Brutal start losing Kenneth. Power roles should stay quiet\u2014Seer only out if you\u2019ve got a wolf; Witch, be cautious with poison. The kill feels like wolves dodging someone who would argue back. I don\u2019t see Joshua making that kill. Between Brenda, Kathleen, and Ronald, Ronald fits that profile more to me. I\u2019m leaning Ronald today but open to being convinced otherwise.\"\n\nTurn #5: Brenda: said: \"Suggest Ronald is the most likely werewolf.\"\n\nTurn #6: Joshua: said: \"Tough hit losing Kenneth. I get the logic that the kill dodges someone who pushes back, which points a bit toward Ronald\u2019s style\u2014but I don\u2019t want to lock in on vibes. Brenda, your quick \u201cRonald is most likely\u201d with no reasoning pings me. Kathleen, need your take. Ronald, walk us through who benefits most from a Kenneth kill and your top suspect. Provisional lean is Ronald for pressure right now, but I\u2019m open to being convinced. Seer should only out on a red; Witch, be careful with poison.\"\n\nTurn #7: Kathleen: said: \"I'm leaning Ronald today but open to being convinced otherwise.  I need confirmation on the kill strategy.\"\n\nTurn #8: Ronald: said: \"\u201cI\u2019m leaning Ronald today but open to being convinced otherwise.\u201d\"\n[Game] Entering state: Day_vote\n\n\nYour available action type(s): [action].\nIt is voting time. You MUST use the command 'vote NAME' to vote for a player to eliminate. e.g. 'vote Alice'\n\nPlease only generate a JSON string including the action type and the argument.\nYour action should follow the given format:\n{\"properties\": {\"action_type\": {\"const\": \"action\", \"description\": \"whether to speak at this turn or choose to not do anything\", \"title\": \"Action Type\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"argument\": {\"description\": \"the utterance if choose to speak, the expression or gesture if choose non-verbal communication, or the physical action if choose action\", \"title\": \"Argument\", \"type\": \"string\"}}, \"required\": [\"action_type\", \"argument\"], \"title\": \"AgentAction\", \"type\": \"object\"}"
