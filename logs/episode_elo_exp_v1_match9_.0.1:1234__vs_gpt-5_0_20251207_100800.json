GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public.

If Stephen is the agitator, a lower-profile partner who avoids planting a clear flag fits; if Karen hedges on committing a vote, that linkage strengthens. Secondary possibility: Stephen + Linda if Linda downplays Stephen\u2019s wording as just banter. If votes were right now, I\u2019d vote Stephen.\"\n\nTurn #7: Linda: said: \"\u201cI think you\u2019re being ridiculously paranoid.  The Seer is *the* key to everything, and she's subtly guiding us.  I\u2019m going to play the role of a cautious observer, not a defiant threat.\u201d\"\n\nTurn #8: Jennifer: said: \"On no night death: either wolves withheld or the Witch saved; Seer actions don\u2019t stop kills. Withholding at 6 is risky, so a save is slightly more likely, but both fit.\n\nTop suspect: Stephen \u2014 talking about \u201cmanipulating\u201d and making the Seer \u201cmy key\u201d reads like seer-hunting and agenda-driven.\nTownlean: Jeffrey \u2014 structured, outcome-focused pressure that helps town.\nSecondary concern: Linda, your \u201cthe Seer is subtly guiding us\u201d line is odd\u2014what exactly do you mean and who do you think is guiding?\n\nI\u2019d vote Stephen now; I\u2019ll reconsider only if he gives a convincing town-motivated explanation and Linda clarifies her stance.\"\n\nTurn #9: Karen: said: \"Flag planted: I would vote Stephen now. His talk about manipulating the conversation and making the Seer his key reads like seer-hunting with no town upside at E-1.\n\nTownlean: Jennifer for the clean no-kill analysis and proactive pressure. Secondary lean: Jeffrey for structure.\n\nLikely pair: Stephen + Linda. Linda calling paranoia, saying the Seer is subtly guiding us, and declining to commit looks like partner cover and a prod toward outing the Seer. Linda: who do you think is 'subtly guiding' and what posts show it?\n\nWhat changes my vote: a Seer red; or Stephen giving a coherent town POV (who are your top two suspects and why, and how does your plan not out the Seer?) plus Linda providing specific reads. Otherwise I stay on Stephen.\"\n[Game] Entering state: Day_vote\n\nTurn #10: Jeffrey: [action] vote Stephen\nStephen: [action] vote Name\nStephanie: [action] vote Stephen\nLinda: [action] vote Alice\nJennifer: [action] vote Stephen\nKaren: [action] vote Stephen\n[Game] Stephen was voted out!\n[Game] Entering state: Night_werewolf\n\nTurn #11: [Game] Entering state: Night_seer\n\nTurn #12: [Game] Entering state: Night_witch\n\n\nYour available action type(s): [action].\nIt is Night.
