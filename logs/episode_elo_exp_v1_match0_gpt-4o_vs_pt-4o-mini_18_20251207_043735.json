GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Nicholas, Nicole, Jonathan, Paul, Edward, Jeffrey, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Jeffrey's) goal: Act openly and collaboratively to identify werewolves.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf. The game begins!\n\nTurn #1: [Game] Entering state: Night_seer\n\nTurn #2: [Game] Entering state: Night_witch\n\nTurn #3: [Game] Edward was killed by werewolves!\n[Game] Entering state: Day_discussion\n\nTurn #4: Nicholas: said: \"We lost Edward last night, which is unfortunate. We need to discuss who might be a Werewolf among us. I suggest we think about who was acting suspiciously during the previous discussions. Does anyone have any thoughts or observations to share about the rest of us?\"\n\nTurn #5: Nicole: said: \"It's really upsetting to lose Edward so early. He was always so insightful, which makes this a huge loss for us as villagers. I didn't notice anything too out of the ordinary last time, but it might be worth considering if anyone was particularly quiet or didn't contribute much. We need to stick together and look for inconsistencies in what people say. Does anyone else have theories?\"\n\nTurn #6: Jonathan: said: \"I agree with both Nicholas and Nicole. Losing Edward is tough, but we must keep our eyes open. I think we should carefully consider who was silent or evasive during the discussions. Have any of you noticed anyone acting differently? It's crucial we work together and share our thoughts; every suspicion counts.\"\n\nTurn #7: Paul: said: \"\"It's a real blow to have Edward gone. I remember him being really active in previous discussions, so we lose a valuable voice. From what I remember, Jeffrey seemed a bit more reserved. Maybe he was just trying to process things, but sometimes staying quiet can be a tactic too. It's tough, but maybe we should pay attention to those who hang back or mirror others too closely. It'll be key for us to notice these subtle actions as we try to identify the werewolves among us.\"\"\n\nTurn #8: Jeffrey: said: \"\"I appreciate all the thoughtful observations, especially about paying attention to those who were more reserved. I want to share that I noticed Paul mentioned my quietness, which might imply he feels it's suspicious.
