WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: John, Donald, Anna, Lisa, Jonathan, David, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Jonathan's) goal: Use save/poison potions strategically to aid villagers.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf.

I'm not sure who exactly is a werewolf, but since Anna was killed, we should focus on discussing who might be trustworthy. I believe we should look for inconsistencies in the statements and patterns in the night actions. Let's keep an open mind and work together to identify the werewolves.\"\n\nTurn #5: Donald: said: \"Anna's death is unfortunate, but it doesn't tell us much. John seems too eager to lead the discussion\u2014maybe he's trying to distract us. Lisa killed Anna? That\u2019s suspicious. Why would a villager kill someone on the first night? I think Lisa is hiding something. We should vote her out today.\"\n\nTurn #6: Lisa: said: \"Donald, you're jumping to conclusions. I didn't kill Anna\u2014I'm a villager trying to survive just like everyone else. You're the one who killed her first, and now you're trying to frame me to divert suspicion. John is being calm and reasonable; you\u2019re the one acting defensively. Don\u2019t try to manipulate the group\u2014look at your own actions.\"\n\nTurn #7: Jonathan: said: \"Donald, your accusation against Lisa is unfounded and doesn't hold up under scrutiny. Anna was killed by the werewolves, not by a villager. As a villager, I believe we should focus on the night actions and use our discussion to identify patterns. Lisa has been open and honest in her statements, and I don't see any reason to suspect her. Let's keep the discussion fair and based on facts, not on personal attacks or assumptions.\"\n\nTurn #8: David: said: \"John, Donald, and Jonathan have all brought up valid points. Anna was indeed killed by the werewolves, and we should focus on the night actions and patterns rather than making unfounded accusations. Donald, while your suspicion of Lisa is strong, there's no evidence to support it\u2014especially since Lisa has been open and cooperative. Jonathan, your point about fairness and logic is well taken. I agree that we should avoid personal attacks and instead look for consistent behavior or contradictions in statements.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: John, Donald, Anna, Lisa, Jonathan, David, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (David's) goal: Act openly and collaboratively to identify werewolves.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf.

John seems too eager to lead the discussion\u2014maybe he's trying to distract us. Lisa killed Anna? That\u2019s suspicious. Why would a villager kill someone on the first night?
