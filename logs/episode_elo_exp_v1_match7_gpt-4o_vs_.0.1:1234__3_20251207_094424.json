WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Joseph, Donna, David, Kathleen, Donald, Thomas, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (David's) goal: Discreetly inspect players at night to uncover werewolves.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf. The game begins!\n\nTurn #1: [Game] Entering state: Night_seer\n\nTurn #2: David: [action] inspect Joseph\n[Private to David] Joseph is on team: Villagers\n[Game] Entering state: Night_witch\n\nTurn #3: [Game] An attack was prevented!\n[Game] Entering state: Day_discussion\n\nTurn #4: Joseph: said: \"Good morning everyone. I'm Joseph. I heard the attack was prevented\u2014this means the Witch used her save potion. That\u2019s a good sign; someone is alive because of a deliberate choice. Let\u2019s think: who might have been targeted? Since the Witch saved someone, it suggests the attack was on a key player\u2014possibly a Seer or an innocent. I\u2019m not sure yet who the Werewolves are, but we should pay attention to anyone acting suspiciously or trying to steer blame. Donna, David, Kathleen, Donald, Thomas\u2014let\u2019s hear your thoughts. Who do you think was targeted? And who might be lying?\"\n\nTurn #5: Donna: said: \"I can't help but feel a little relieved about the Witch using their save potion. It's always a stressful night knowing someone might not see the morning. Joseph, you might be onto something by suggesting a key player was targeted. Could it be a ploy by the Werewolves to cause panic? It's definitely suspicious how the attempt failed. It makes me think that they fear one of us may be too dangerous if left alive. We need to tread carefully with our accusations but also be decisive. My eyes are on those who might be trying to fly under the radar. What about you guys? I\u2019m not entirely convinced it couldn\u2019t have been Donald\u2014he's been oddly quiet.\"\n\nTurn #6: David: said: \"Thanks, Joseph and Donna. I agree the Witch\u2019s save was crucial\u2014someone was definitely targeted. Since the attack was prevented, the target must\u2019ve been someone the Werewolves saw as a threat. Joseph mentioned the Seer or an innocent, but I wonder if the Werewolves were trying to eliminate someone who could expose them. David here\u2014I didn\u2019t do anything suspicious, but I\u2019m curious: Donald\u2019s quietness is notable. Why hasn\u2019t he spoken yet? That could be nervousness\u2026 or planning. Let\u2019s hear from Kathleen and Thomas next.\"\n\nTurn #7: Kathleen: said: \"Good morning, everyone. I have to say, it's a huge relief knowing the Witch was able to prevent an attack. I agree with Joseph and Donna that this points to someone important likely being targeted\u2014a Seer or an innocent seems plausible. We've got to be vigilant, judging by how targeted these moves are. Now, I\u2019ve been observing, and I concur with David about Donald's quietness standing out. Perhaps he's trying to fly under the radar or has something on his mind. Either way, I'd love to hear more from him, and also, Thomas hasn\u2019t had the chance to share his thoughts yet. Maybe we\u2019re missing a crucial perspective that could guide our decisions moving forward.\"\n\nTurn #8: Donald: said: \"I appreciate everyone\u2019s thoughts, and I understand my silence may seem suspicious\u2014but I\u2019ve been listening carefully. The Witch saved me last night, and that\u2019s not a coincidence. If I were a Werewolf, why would I save myself? That wouldn\u2019t help the Wolves win. I\u2019m not the target\u2014I\u2019m the one who was saved. And if anyone\u2019s trying to deflect blame by pointing at me, that\u2019s exactly what a Werewolf would do.
