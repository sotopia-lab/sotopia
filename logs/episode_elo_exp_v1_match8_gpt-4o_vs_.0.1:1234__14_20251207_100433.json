GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act.

NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public.

WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'.

                    "content": "Imagine you are playing the game as Rebecca.\n\nHere is the description of the game: This game is called Werewolves (also known as Mafia), which is a social deduction game.  GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Jason, Kathleen, Rebecca, Nicholas, Richard, Karen, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Rebecca's) goal: Discreetly inspect players at night to uncover werewolves.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf. The game begins!\n\nTurn #1: [Game] Entering state: Night_seer\n\nTurn #2: Rebecca: [action] inspect Nicholas\n[Private to Rebecca] Nicholas is on team: Werewolves\n[Game] Entering state: Night_witch\n\nTurn #3: [Game] Jason was killed by werewolves!\n[Game] Entering state: Day_discussion\n\nTurn #4: Kathleen: said: \"It's strange that Jason was targeted first, given he seemed quite level-headed. Whoever picked him was likely worried about his observations during discussions, don't you think? I'd suggest we pay close attention to anyone who had disagreements with him yesterday.\"\n\nTurn #5: Rebecca: said: \"Jason being killed first does seem suspicious, especially since he was seen as a stable player. I'm not sure if that was a strategic move or just a random choice. I'm also thinking about who might have been targeted\u2014perhaps someone with strong opinions or who stood out during discussions. I'll keep an eye on Nicholas, since I just inspected him and he's a werewolf. That might help us narrow down the group.\"\n\nTurn #6: Nicholas: said: \"\"I understand where you're coming from, Rebecca. Admittedly, having Jason eliminated right off the bat is unsettling. It does seem like a strategic move to target someone perceived as a threat, but I'm honestly perplexed about why I'd ever draw that kind of attention so early. He never really suspected me, and frankly, most of his focus seemed elsewhere. Maybe the werewolves are throwing us off track, creating suspicion where it doesn't belong. Let's not jump to conclusions too early.\"\"\n\nTurn #7: Richard: said: \"Rebecca, I appreciate your insight about Nicholas being a werewolf, but I want to clarify\u2014my inspection didn't show him as a werewolf. I think it's important to be cautious about drawing conclusions based on assumptions. Jason's elimination feels like a potential wolf move, but we need more evidence. I'm also curious about Karen\u2014she was saved by Richard tonight, and I think she might be a key player. Let's keep an eye on her behavior during discussion and avoid making hasty accusations.\"\n\nTurn #8: Karen: said: \"Richard, thank you for mentioning my name and highlighting my role in the night. I want to be clear\u2014I did not know I was saved, and I appreciate that you brought it up. I've been trying to stay neutral and listen closely to everyone's observations. Jason's early elimination does feel like a strategic move, and I agree it's worth examining carefully. I don't have any personal suspicions yet, but I'm open to discussion and will keep an eye on anyone who seems out of place or inconsistent, especially if their statements don't align with others' reports. Let's focus on gathering facts and working together to identify the truth.\"\n[Game] Entering state: Day_vote\n\nTurn #9: Kathleen: [action] vote Karen\nRebecca: [action] vote Nicholas\nNicholas: [action] vote Rebecca\nRichard: [action] vote Nicholas\nKaren: [action] vote Nicholas\n[Game] Nicholas was voted out!\n[Game] Entering state: Night_werewolf\n\nTurn #10: [Game] Entering state: Night_seer\n\nTurn #11: Rebecca: [action] inspect Karen\n[Private to Rebecca] Karen is on team: Villagers\n[Game] Entering state: Night_witch\n\nTurn #12: [Game] Richard was killed by werewolves!\n[Game] Entering state: Day_discussion\n\nTurn #13: Kathleen: said: \"\"Another player taken by the werewolves in the night - Richard, a pivotal player. Truly unfortunate, as he was one of the few fostering open discussion. Now, Karen's name was mentioned earlier due to Richard\u2019s intervention, but let's not hastily assume connections based on saved actions alone. We can't ignore the possibility of a diversion tactic. It's crucial to scrutinize any sudden shifts in behavior or inconsistencies in stories. I'm interested to hear what new insights others might have on last night's events. Unity and a clear mind are our greatest assets now.\"\"\n\nTurn #14: Rebecca: said: \"Richard's elimination feels like a significant loss, especially given his role in encouraging open discussion. Since he was not a werewolf, his death likely points to a wolf targeting someone perceived as trustworthy or neutral. Karen was saved, which might suggest she is not a werewolf, and my inspection confirmed she is a villager. This strengthens the idea that the werewolves are acting strategically\u2014possibly eliminating players who could reveal inconsistencies or who are seen as reliable. I still suspect Nicholas, but his vote might have been a result of the current pressure. We need to remain vigilant and focus on behavior patterns, especially from those who have not been directly inspected or acted upon.\"\n\nTurn #15: Karen: said: \"I appreciate the thoughtful discussion everyone has shared. Richard's elimination is indeed a major loss, and I agree that his openness and fairness made him a key figure in our group dynamics. Since I was saved by Richard, and I know he was not a werewolf, this further supports the idea that we are dealing with a strategic elimination pattern. I remain neutral in my suspicions and do not have any personal accusations. However, I do notice that Nicholas has been heavily targeted in both votes and statements\u2014his earlier claim about not being suspected might seem inconsistent given the current context. I will keep observing his behavior and remain open to new information. Let's continue to focus on consistency, behavior, and the pattern of eliminations rather than jumping to conclusions.\"\n[Game] Entering state: Day_vote\n\nTurn #16: Kathleen: [action] vote Karen\nRebecca: [action] vote Nicholas\nKaren: [action] vote Nicholas\n[Game] Nicholas was voted out!\n[Game] Entering state: Night_werewolf\n\nTurn #17: [Game] Entering state: Night_seer\n\n\nYour available action type(s): [action].\nIt is Night.
