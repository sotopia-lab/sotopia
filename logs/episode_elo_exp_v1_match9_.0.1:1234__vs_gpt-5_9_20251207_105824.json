WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone.

WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed.

NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Ashley, Kathleen, Brenda, Betty, Angela, Nancy, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Ashley's) goal: Act openly and collaboratively to identify werewolves.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf.

WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'.

Avoid inspecting whoever looks like a nightkill magnet.\n\nQuick reads: \n- Town-lean: Ashley (structured, pro-elim), Brenda (pushes and commits), Angela (calls out the slip, asks good questions). \n- Scum-lean: Kathleen (copy with no own take). \n- Top suspect: Betty pending clarification.\n\nQuestions: \n- Betty: Was \u201cmanipulating\u201d a joke? Give your top elim and who you\u2019d inspect, with reasons. \n- Kathleen: Give one concrete elim choice now and why, in your own words. Do you see Betty\u2019s line as a slip?\n\nVote plan: Default on Betty; if she clears it up well, I\u2019ll vote Kathleen.\"\n[Game] Entering state: Day_vote\n\nTurn #10: Ashley: [action] vote Betty\nKathleen: [action] action\nBrenda: [action] vote Betty\nBetty: [action] vote Alice\nAngela: [action] vote Betty\nNancy: [action] vote Betty\n[Game] Betty was voted out!\n[Game] Entering state: Night_werewolf\n\nTurn #11: [Game] Entering state: Night_seer\n\nTurn #12: [Game] Entering state: Night_witch\n\nTurn #13: [Game] Entering state: Day_discussion\n\nTurn #14: Ashley: said: \"Dawn check: I don\u2019t see a night death announced. Host/mod, can we get confirmation if anyone died last night? That matters for whether today is must-eliminate. If no one died and Betty was town, we\u2019re at LYLO and Seer should claim. If there was a death or Betty was a wolf, Seer only claims with a wolf (red) result.\n\nReads going into today:\n- Kathleen: Top suspect. D1 you echoed my opener verbatim and didn\u2019t place a vote. That\u2019s classic hedge/non-commit. I need your strongest single elimination pick right now, in your own words, plus why you didn\u2019t vote yesterday.\n- Brenda, Angela, Nancy: Still town-lean for proactive pushing and clear stances. Re-evaluate Kathleen with me and give your exact vote preference today. Also weigh in on the Seer-claim plan contingent on the night result.\n\nPlan:\n- First, confirm if there was a night death.\n- If no death: Seer claims immediately; we sort from there.\n- If there was a death: Seer stays quiet unless you have a red.\n\nPending that info, I\u2019m leaning to vote Kathleen but will wait for her response and the night result confirmation.\"\n\nTurn #15: Kathleen: said: \"\u201cGood morning. Let\u2019s keep this tight and useful: 1) If you had to eliminate someone right now, who and why? 2) If you were Seer tonight, who would you inspect and why? Seer should only claim if you have a wolf result; otherwise stay hidden. Witch, please don\u2019t out unless absolutely necessary. We need an elimination today at 6 players; no-elim is bad. I\u2019ll hold my vote until I hear from everyone, but I\u2019ll lean toward players who hedge or refuse to name names.\u201d\"\n\nTurn #16: Brenda: said: \"Hard claim: I\u2019m the Seer. Results \u2014 N1: Ashley is Villager (green). N2: Kathleen is Werewolf (red). Please vote Kathleen today. I said yesterday I\u2019d inspect Angela/Nancy as cover; I actually checked Ashley N1 to avoid being predictable. Kathleen\u2019s repeat-posting and no D1 vote already looked bad; the red seals it. If anyone counterclaims me, do it now. Otherwise, Ashley/Angela/Nancy, let\u2019s consolidate on Kathleen.\"\n\nTurn #17: Angela: said: \"No night death seen. Brenda\u2019s claim fits both the game state and her D1 tone. Unless there\u2019s an immediate counterclaim, I\u2019m treating Brenda as real and will vote Kathleen. \n\nKathleen: this is your window. Either counterclaim with two results or explain why Brenda would red-check you. If you don\u2019t, I\u2019m locking on you. \n\nAshley\u2019s green tracks with my read. Nancy, are you good to vote Kathleen here? If we eliminate a wolf today, priority tonight is keeping the Seer alive; protect if possible. I\u2019m ready to consolidate on Kathleen.\"\n\nTurn #18: Nancy: said: \"I don\u2019t see a night death either; assuming that\u2019s correct, if Betty was town this is LYLO. Brenda\u2019s Seer claim (Ashley green, Kathleen red) matches her D1 tone and is exactly what we need today. Unless there\u2019s an immediate counterclaim with two results, I\u2019m treating Brenda as real and will vote Kathleen. \n\nKathleen: This is your spot to respond. Either counterclaim with two peeks or explain why Brenda would red-check you\u2014and also address the copy/paste and your no-vote yesterday. \n\nIf no CC, I\u2019m ready to lock on Kathleen and will place my vote next phase. Ashley is conftown if Brenda\u2019s real; Angela remains town-lean for process.
