WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager.

WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'.

Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public.

DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed.

WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Christopher, Paul, Larry, Donna, Margaret, Deborah, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Margaret's) goal: Use save/poison potions strategically to aid villagers.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf.

Since we only get one pass each, let\u2019s be efficient. Seer: only claim if you have a red (a werewolf) and state who you inspected; if that happens, I will vote the named wolf today and expect the accused to respond. Witch: please don\u2019t out yourself; conserve info unless absolutely necessary. Everyone else: give (1) your top suspect and why, (2) one player you currently trust and why, and (3) who you\u2019d vote right now. Please avoid vague \u201cgut\u201d with no reason\u2014give something we can hold you to later. Paul, you\u2019re up\u2014who\u2019s your vote right now and why?\"\n\nTurn #5: Paul: did nothing\n\nTurn #6: Larry: said: \"No night-kill is interesting\u2014either a save or wolves held. Answering Christopher: (1) Top suspect: Paul. Skipping when asked for reads looks like avoiding commitment. (2) Trust: Light townlean on Christopher for setting a clear, accountable plan. (3) I\u2019d vote Paul right now to pressure content. Paul, can you share your top suspect, one townlean, and your current vote? Donna, Margaret, Deborah\u2014same questions so we have a baseline to compare later.\"\n\nTurn #7: Donna: said: \"I'm still trying to figure out how to play this game. It seems like you\u2019re giving me a lot of information and I need to be careful about what I say.  I'm not sure I understand the rules completely yet.\"\n\nTurn #8: Margaret: said: \"Morning. No night kill: could be wolves withheld or a save; given N1 chaos, I slightly lean withheld/bungle over a successful save, but not ruling it out.\n\nMy answers:\n- Top suspect: Paul. He skipped when prodded and after being asked directly. That dodges accountability.\n- Trust: Light townlean on Christopher for setting a clear, testable plan; mild for Larry for pushing.\n- Vote right now: Paul, to pressure content.\n\nDonna: totally fine to be new\u2014give one person you think is likely good and one you\u2019d vote, with any reason at all. Simple is fine. Paul: please share your top suspect, one townlean, and where you\u2019d vote.\n\nDeborah, you\u2019re up\u2014who\u2019s your vote and why?\"\n\nTurn #9: Deborah: said: \"Agree that no night-kill isn\u2019t alignment-indicative by itself\u2014could be a witch save or wolves withheld. My reads: (1) Top suspect: Paul. Skipping after being directly asked looks like avoiding accountability. If you\u2019re town, we need your suspect, one townlean, and where you\u2019d vote before EoD. (2) Trust: Light townlean on Christopher for a clear, testable plan; mild on Margaret for staking positions with reasons. (3) I\u2019d vote Paul right now to pressure content. If he returns with solid reads, I\u2019m open to pivoting; I don\u2019t want to elim Donna today for newness alone unless something clearly wolfy pairs with it.\"\n[Game] Entering state: Day_vote\n\nTurn #10: Christopher: [action] vote Paul\nPaul: [action] vote Alice\nLarry: [action] vote Paul\nDonna: [action] vote Alice\nMargaret: [action] vote Paul\nDeborah: [action] vote Paul\n[Game] Paul was voted out!\n[Game] Entering state: Night_werewolf\n\nTurn #11: [Game] Entering state: Night_seer\n\nTurn #12: [Game] Entering state: Night_witch\n\nTurn #13: Margaret: [action] skip\n[Game] Entering state: Day_discussion\n\nTurn #14: Christopher: said: \"Good morning. Seer: only claim if you have a red today; include who you inspected N1 and N2. Witch: please stay quiet unless absolutely necessary.\n\nQuick D1 framework:\n- If Paul was town: likely at least one wolf was on his wagon among Larry, Margaret, Deborah. I side-eye the earliest pusher, Larry, for setting tempo on a consensus that never needed to move.\n- If Paul was wolf: partner is likely either off-wagon Donna or a strategic busser; of the bussers, Margaret and Deborah felt more process-driven, so Larry still edges scummier.\n\nMy reads:\n- Top suspect: Larry. Donna is second for off-wagon non-participation, but I want to give her one clear, structured chance today.\n- Townleans: Margaret slight town for consistent, accountable reasoning; Deborah slight town for openness to pivot with clear criteria.\n\nWhat I want from each:\n- Larry, Margaret, Deborah: pick one of the other two on-wagon voters who is more likely a wolf and why; also give a likely partner in both Paul-town and Paul-wolf worlds.\n- Donna: give us (a) one person you think is good and why, (b) one person you would eliminate today and why, and (c) confirm you understand votes must be for living players here.\n\nWhere I would vote right now: Larry, pending any red claim or strong counter-arguments.\"\n\nTurn #15: Larry: said: \"Christopher, I hear your concern. My D1 push on Paul was to force content; with one pass each, letting skips slide helps wolves. The wagon gave us accountable reasons to sort today.\n\nBetween Margaret and Deborah, I think Deborah is more likely a wolf. Her vote tracked consensus with hedging (\u201copen to pivot\u201d) but she still parked there; Margaret\u2019s stance felt more process-driven and initiating.\n\nWorldbuilding:\n- If Paul was town: I expect at least one wolf on-wagon\u2014Deborah fits best. Likely partner: Donna (off-wagon, low participation, invalid vote on Alice avoids accountability).\n- If Paul was wolf: Most likely partner is Donna (off-wagon, non-participation, invalid vote instead of a bus). Deborah-as-busser is possible but secondary.\n\nDonna: please give (a) one person you think is good and why, (b) one person you\u2019d elim today and why, and (c) confirm you know votes must be for living players here.\n\nWhere I\u2019d vote now: Deborah. If Donna can\u2019t give concrete reads this round, I\u2019m fine pivoting there.\"\n\nTurn #16: Donna: said: \"Morning! It seems like you\u2019re giving me a lot of information and I need to be careful about what I say.  I'm not sure I understand the rules completely yet.\"\n\nTurn #17: Margaret: said: \"Donna: quick rules help\u2014your vote must be for a living player: Christopher, Larry, Donna, Margaret, or Deborah. Example: type exactly 'vote Larry' (or any living name you choose). Please give (a) one person you think is good and why, (b) one person you\u2019d eliminate today and why.\n\nChristopher\u2019s prompt:\n- Between Larry and Deborah, I think Larry is more likely a wolf. Reason: D1 he set the early tempo on Paul, and today he\u2019s pushing Deborah while keeping Donna framed as a universal partner in both worlds. That feels agenda-driven and preps two easy eliminations.\n- Partners:\n  \u2022 If Paul was town: I expect at least one wolf on-wagon; I\u2019d pick Larry there. Likely partner: Donna (off-wagon, invalid vote avoids accountability).\n  \u2022 If Paul was wolf: Most likely partner is Donna (off-wagon avoiding a bus). If there was a bus, Larry is more plausible than Deborah; Deborah\u2019s D1 willingness to pivot with criteria reads more town-driven.\n- Where I\u2019d vote now: Larry. I\u2019m not interested in elim\u2019ing Deborah today. If Donna can\u2019t provide clear, concrete reads after this guidance, I\u2019d consider her next, but Larry first.\"\n\nTurn #18: Deborah: said: \"Two straight no-kills likely means a save or wolves withheld at least once; not alignment-indicative by itself.\n\nChristopher\u2019s prompt:\n- Between Larry and Margaret, I think Larry is more likely a wolf. Reasons: (1) D1 he set early tempo on Paul and rode the easy wagon; (2) today he pushes me while pre-framing Donna as partner in both worlds, which preps two convenient eliminations; (3) he mischaracterizes my D1 stance\u2014saying I \u201chedged\u201d\u2014when I explicitly laid out pressure with clear pivot criteria if Paul produced content.\n- Worlds:\n  \u2022 If Paul was town: I expect at least one wolf on-wagon; I\u2019d pick Larry there. Likely partner: Donna (off-wagon, invalid vote avoided accountability), but I want her takes before locking that in.\n  \u2022 If Paul was wolf: If no bus, partner is most likely Donna (avoids the bus). If there was a bus, Larry > Margaret as the busser.\n\nLarry, your case on me ignores that conditional pressure is how town gets info. Calling that hedge reads like agenda.\n\nDonna: to vote, type exactly \u2018vote NAME\u2019 where NAME is one of Christopher, Larry, Margaret, or Deborah. Please share (a) one person you think is good and why, and (b) one person you\u2019d eliminate today and why\u2014even a simple reason is fine.\n\nWhere I\u2019d vote right now: Larry.
