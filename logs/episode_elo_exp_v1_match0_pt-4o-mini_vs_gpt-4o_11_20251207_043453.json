GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Emma, James, Jennifer, Dorothy, Susan, Scott, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Jennifer's) goal: Discreetly inspect players at night to uncover werewolves.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf.

Perhaps we should focus on gathering more information before we start pointing fingers at the quieter ones among us!\"\"\n\nTurn #8: Susan: said: \"\"Hello everyone, good morning! It's great to hear that the attack was prevented, and luckily, James is still with us. I saved him last night not because I know his allegiance, but because it seemed like the best move to protect as many villagers as possible during this early stage. I agree that we should listen to everyone and try to piece together any inconsistencies we notice in what people say. While I don\u2019t have certainty about who the Werewolves are, I recommend we focus on transparency and encourage everyone to share whatever they can. If the Seer has any information from last night, that could be immensely helpful to us right now.\"\"\n\nTurn #9: Scott: said: \"Good morning, everyone. I'm relieved the attack was prevented last night, and I appreciate the efforts to keep us safe. I understand the concerns about my silence, but it's more about gathering my thoughts than anything suspicious.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Emma, James, Jennifer, Dorothy, Susan, Scott, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Dorothy's) goal: Deceive others, avoid detection, and eliminate villagers.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf. The game begins!\nJames: [action] kill Emma\n\nTurn #1: Dorothy: [action] kill James\n[Game] Entering state: Night_seer\n\nTurn #2: [Game] Entering state: Night_witch\n\nTurn #3: [Game] An attack was prevented!\n[Game] Entering state: Day_discussion\n\nTurn #4: Emma: said: \"Good morning everyone. It seems an attack was prevented last night, which is a relief. I'm curious about who the Seer might have inspected last night and if they have any useful information to share that could guide us. Let's figure out who to trust and be cautious about those whose motives seem unclear. Keeping the village safe is our priority, so if you have any insights or suspicions, please share.\"\n\nTurn #5: James: said: \"\"Good morning, everyone. I agree with Emma; it's a relief that the attack was prevented. However, we need to be vigilant. I have a suspect in mind\u2014Scott has been quite silent since the game started, which makes me wonder about his intentions. What do you all think? Let's scrutinize those who are less vocal, as they might be hiding something.\"\"\n\nTurn #6: Jennifer: said: \"\"Hello everyone, good morning. I agree that last night\u2019s prevention is good news. While we consider possible suspects, let\u2019s also remember to listen carefully to each other and observe patterns. While being quiet might be suspicious, it\u2019s also a common cover for the Werewolves to deflect attention. Personally, I'd like to hear more from Dorothy, who has also been somewhat reserved. Let's be open to all possibilities and see what unfolds as people speak more.\"\"\n\nTurn #7: Dorothy: said: \"\"Good morning, everyone! I\u2019m glad the attack was prevented too, but I must say, I find James's accusations toward Scott quite interesting. Scott might be quiet, but that doesn\u2019t automatically make him suspicious. Let\u2019s not jump to conclusions without more evidence. I'm also curious about what the Seer discovered last night since that could help us identify the Werewolves. Perhaps we should focus on gathering more information before we start pointing fingers at the quieter ones among us!\"\"\n\nTurn #8: Susan: said: \"\"Hello everyone, good morning! It's great to hear that the attack was prevented, and luckily, James is still with us. I saved him last night not because I know his allegiance, but because it seemed like the best move to protect as many villagers as possible during this early stage. I agree that we should listen to everyone and try to piece together any inconsistencies we notice in what people say. While I don\u2019t have certainty about who the Werewolves are, I recommend we focus on transparency and encourage everyone to share whatever they can. If the Seer has any information from last night, that could be immensely helpful to us right now.\"\"\n\nTurn #9: Scott: said: \"Good morning, everyone. I'm relieved the attack was prevented last night, and I appreciate the efforts to keep us safe. I understand the concerns about my silence, but it's more about gathering my thoughts than anything suspicious. I agree that it's wise to wait for the Seer's information because it could significantly help narrow down the suspects. Let's continue to communicate openly and avoid drawing premature conclusions. I'm here to work together to protect our village, and I hope we'll find the Werewolves soon. By the way, Susan, thank you for saving someone last night and for your transparency about it. It brings an extra layer of trust and might come in handy in our discussions today.\"\n[Game] Entering state: Day_vote\n\nTurn #10: Emma: [action] vote James\nJames: [action] vote Scott\nJennifer: [action] vote James\nDorothy: [action] vote Scott\nSusan: [action] vote Scott\nScott: [action] vote James\n[Game] James was voted out!\n[Game] Entering state: Night_werewolf\n\nTurn #11: Dorothy: [action] kill Susan\n[Game] Entering state: Night_seer\n\nTurn #12: [Game] Entering state: Night_witch\n\nTurn #13: [Game] Susan was killed by werewolves!\n[Game] Scott died by witch's poison!\n[Game] Entering state: Day_discussion\n\nTurn #14: Emma: said: \"Good morning, everyone. It appears we lost both Susan, who was bravely open about her actions, and Scott overnight. Susan\u2019s honesty and transparency were commendable, but it also made her an easy target. We can\u2019t let their sacrifices go in vain. With three of us left, including Jennifer, Dorothy, and me, we must rely on what observations we made so far. Jennifer, Dorothy, any new insights or observations? Remember, collaboration is our best chance at identifying the last Werewolf.
