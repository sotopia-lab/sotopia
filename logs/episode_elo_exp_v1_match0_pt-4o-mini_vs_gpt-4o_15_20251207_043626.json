GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Scott, Dorothy, Kevin, Brandon, Susan, Cynthia, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Kevin's) goal: Discreetly inspect players at night to uncover werewolves.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf.

It seems like the attack was prevented last night. That's a relief! Since the Witch might have played a role in this, perhaps they have some insight, though I understand they might want to keep their cards close for now. I think it might be useful to share any observations or suspicions to narrow down who could be responsible for these attacks. Does anyone have any leads or thoughts on who might have been targeted, or any general hunches?\"\n\nTurn #5: Dorothy: said: \"\"I agree with Scott! It's crucial we share our suspicions. I have a feeling the attack was directed at someone who might have been perceived as a threat. Kevin and Susan are both quite vocal, so targeting one of them would make sense for the werewolves. Let's discuss who we think could be next on the list of targets and see if anyone has specific insights!\"\"\n\nTurn #6: Kevin: said: \"Based on my observations, I've noticed that we might want to keep an eye on Brandon and Cynthia. Scott, I don't suspect you at all since you seem genuinely concerned about the village's safety.

However, I think we need to be cautious about jumping to conclusions too quickly. Kevin's suspicion on me and Cynthia could be an attempt to distract us.

I've been thinking a lot about the nature of the attack last night. It's clear that someone needed protection, and I'm grateful that was possible. Now, it's crucial we concentrate on gathering as much solid information as possible from what we each observed. \n\nSince I'm one of the suspects mentioned, I'll say I'm prepared to answer any questions or clarify anything to help us identify the werewolves. Kevin's point about Brandon and Cynthia is interesting, but I urge everyone to consider all angles and lookout for any diversion tactics the werewolves might be using to create chaos or confusion.\"\"\n\nTurn #9: Cynthia: said: \"Thank you, everyone, for sharing. I believe caution and evidence-based discussions will serve us well. Kevin, I understand the concern you raised about me and Brandon, but I'd like to assure everyone that I'm dedicated to finding the werewolves. It seems to me the werewolves would target vocal players to silence dissent or try to make others suspicious through misinformation. \n\nI propose we shift our focus towards observations from the previous night that each of us might have noticed. Who did we expect might be attacked, why might the werewolves have chosen that target, and what motives would they have had?

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public.
