WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Laura, Emily, Anthony, Jacob, Thomas, Melissa, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Melissa's) goal: Act openly and collaboratively to identify werewolves.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf.

I'm not sure who among us is a werewolf, but I think we need to focus on discussing the possible suspects. Since Thomas was eliminated, maybe one of the others is acting suspiciously. I\u2019ll keep an open mind and listen to everyone\u2019s thoughts.\"\n\nTurn #5: Emily: said: \"Thomas's death is a blow to us. It's hard to point fingers, but I think we should pay attention to Jacob's actions. He seemed quiet last round, and that might be a strategy to avoid suspicion. Let's hear from everyone and gather more insights before making hasty decisions.\"\n\nTurn #6: Anthony: said: \"I'm not sure about any specific suspect yet, but Thomas's death is unfortunate. Since Emily was inspected and found to be a werewolf, that's a key point. I'm cautious about jumping to conclusions, but I think we should keep an eye on Jacob and Melissa, as their behavior might reveal something. Let's stay vigilant and make sure we don't let any misinformation cloud our judgment.\"\n\nTurn #7: Jacob: said: \"It's unfortunate about Thomas. Losing a fellow player so early is tough. I understand the need to be cautious, but I think blaming me just because I was quieter isn't the most sound strategy. We're all trying to figure things out here. I haven't noticed anything overtly suspicious outside the norm, so maybe we need more clues or pieces of the puzzle. Let's ensure we\u2019re all examining actions critically and attempting to uncover the behavior patterns together. Also, Anthony, it's interesting that you\u2019re so sure about Emily's role. Can you clarify how you know for sure she's a werewolf? Transparency in our reasoning might help us more in the long run.\"\n\nTurn #8: Melissa: said: \"I appreciate Jacob's point about transparency and critical thinking. I want to clarify that I made a mistake in my earlier statement \u2014 Emily was not inspected by the seer. That information is incorrect, and I apologize for spreading misinformation. Thomas's death is indeed unfortunate, and we need to be careful not to jump to conclusions based on faulty assumptions.
