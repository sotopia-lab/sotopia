GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act.

NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed.

If the seer confirms Mark as a wolf, I\u2019ll follow that red. Otherwise, I\u2019ll vote for Christopher, who has been inconsistent in his statements and seems out of place in the group.\"\n\nTurn #6: Mark: said: \"Claiming Seer: I inspected Jonathan last night; result = Werewolf. This is eliminate-or-lose; please follow the seer red and execute Jonathan today. If there\u2019s a counterclaim, resolve within the claims; otherwise, don\u2019t split the vote. Jonathan\u2019s push on me is just self-preservation. I\u2019ll vote Jonathan when voting opens; we can hunt his partner after the flip by watching who resists this.\"\n\nTurn #7: Shirley: said: \"I do not agree with Mark's claim that Jonathan is a werewolf. I inspected Mark last night and the result was Villager. This means Mark is not a wolf, and his accusation against Jonathan is likely a lie to shift blame. I believe Mark is trying to manipulate the situation by falsely claiming to see a wolf. My top suspect remains Christopher, who has been acting suspiciously and has not participated in discussions. If the seer confirms anyone else, I will follow that red. Otherwise, I will vote for Christopher because of his inconsistency and lack of engagement. I do not follow a seer red unless it is confirmed and supported by evidence.\"\n\nTurn #8: Barbara: said: \"Karen feels most town: her ELO plan (force seer claim, execute within claims) is the right structure here. With two seer claims now, we should resolve between them today. Between Mark and Shirley, I strongly prefer executing Shirley: her \u201cI inspected Mark = Villager\u201d while refusing to follow a red at ELO is inconsistent and anti-town, and a green on the other claimant doesn\u2019t make sense as a counter. I\u2019ll vote Shirley to keep consensus tight. If there\u2019s another seer claim from Christopher with concrete results, we can reassess, but absent that I\u2019m on Shirley.\"\n\nTurn #9: Christopher: said: \"Agree it\u2019s ELO and the save likely fired. With two seer claims we should resolve within the claims today per Karen\u2019s plan. Between them, Shirley\u2019s counter is inconsistent: she says she \u2018inspected Mark = Villager\u2019 but then refuses to follow a red and pushes me. If she\u2019s real, a green on Mark makes his red on Jonathan more credible, not less. That contradiction is wolfy. I\u2019m treating Mark as the real seer. Provisional vote: Shirley. Jonathan, please address Mark\u2019s red directly\u2014will you vote within the claims? I\u2019ll stick with Shirley unless a third claim with concrete info appears (not me).\"\n[Game] Entering state: Day_vote\n\nTurn #10: Karen: [action] vote Shirley\nJonathan: [action] vote Christopher\nMark: [action] vote Shirley\nShirley: [action] vote Christopher\nBarbara: [action] vote Shirley\nChristopher: [action] vote Shirley\n[Game] Shirley was voted out!\n[Game] Entering state: Night_werewolf\n\nTurn #11: [Game] Entering state: Night_seer\n\nTurn #12: [Game] Entering state: Night_witch\n\n\nYour available action type(s): [action].\nIt is Night.
