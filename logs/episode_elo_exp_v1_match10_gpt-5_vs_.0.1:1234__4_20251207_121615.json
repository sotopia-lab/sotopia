GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act.

NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Steven, Shirley, Karen, Anna, Melissa, Brian, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Melissa's) goal: Use save/poison potions strategically to aid villagers.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf. The game begins!\n\nTurn #1: [Game] Entering state: Night_seer\n\nTurn #2: [Game] Entering state: Night_witch\n\nTurn #3: Melissa: [action] save Steven\n[Game] An attack was prevented!\n[Game] Entering state: Day_discussion\n\nTurn #4: Steven: said: \"Good morning everyone. I'm Steven. I heard the attack was prevented\u2014so someone used the save potion. That\u2019s a big clue! The Witch saved someone, which means the target was likely innocent or critical to the villagers\u2019 survival. Let\u2019s think: who was at risk? We should look for inconsistencies in alibis and see if anyone is trying to deflect blame. I\u2019m open to hearing everyone\u2019s thoughts\u2014let\u2019s work together to find the werewolves.\"\n\nTurn #5: Shirley: said: \"Morning. Great save last night. Witch, please stay hidden; Seer only claim if you\u2019ve got a red. The save doesn\u2019t clear anyone. Let\u2019s standardize: everyone share (1) who you would\u2019ve killed N1 and why, and (2) your top suspect right now. Dodging that will look bad. For me: I\u2019d probably hit a visible coordinator like Steven or Karen to disrupt town. Light eye on Brian for potential coasting, but it\u2019s tentative. Karen, your turn.\"\n\nTurn #6: Karen: said: \"Thanks, Shirley. I appreciate the structure. To answer: I didn\u2019t target anyone at night since I\u2019m the Seer\u2014I used my inspection on Steven, and he\u2019s confirmed Villager. That means the attack was real, and the Witch saved someone important. My top suspect right now is Brian\u2014he\u2019s quiet, doesn\u2019t engage much, and just now seemed to coast without offering any insight. If he\u2019s a Werewolf, he\u2019s playing it safe. Melissa and Anna, I\u2019d love to hear your takes too.\"\n\nTurn #7: Anna: said: \"Anna here. Answering Shirley\u2019s prompts: (1) If I were a wolf N1, I\u2019d hit a visible coordinator like Steven or Karen to disrupt town direction. (2) Top suspect: I\u2019m uneasy with Karen\u2019s early Seer claim on a green. Claiming with no red is unusual and can pocket Steven while putting a target on her back. That said, I don\u2019t want to execute a claimed Seer without a counterclaim. Brian is my frontrunner right now for coasting and offering little\u2014pending his contribution. Melissa, where are you at on Karen\u2019s claim and who\u2019s your top suspect?\"\n\nTurn #8: Melissa: said: \"Thanks for the insights, everyone. I\u2019ll be honest\u2014I saved Steven because he seemed like a natural leader and someone who could help us coordinate the day. I\u2019m not the Seer, but I do think Karen\u2019s claim needs more scrutiny: if she inspected Steven and he\u2019s Villager, why didn\u2019t she share that *before* the save? That timing feels suspicious. Brian\u2019s quietness is concerning, but so is Karen\u2019s sudden, convenient claim after the save. I\u2019m leaning toward Karen as a potential Werewolf trying to manipulate our trust. Brian, if you\u2019re innocent, speak up now\u2014your silence is loud.\"\n\nTurn #9: Brian: said: \"I hear everyone\u2019s concerns, and I get why my silence is standing out. But let me clarify: I\u2019m not hiding\u2014I\u2019m listening, trying to piece this together. Karen claims she inspected Steven and he\u2019s Villager, but if that\u2019s true, why didn\u2019t she say it before the save? That does feel off. Melissa saved Steven\u2014great move\u2014but now both her and Karen are pointing fingers in a way that benefits each other. I\u2019m not the Seer, and I didn\u2019t kill anyone. My top suspect is Karen: her claim came right after the save, it\u2019s convenient, and she\u2019s steering focus onto me while avoiding scrutiny. I don\u2019t trust the timing or the narrative. Let\u2019s not execute someone based on silence\u2014we need evidence. I\u2019m open to discussion, but don\u2019t let a coordinated story fool us.\"\n[Game] Entering state: Day_vote\n\nTurn #10: Steven: [action] vote Karen\nShirley: [action] vote Brian\nKaren: [action] vote Karen\nAnna: [action] vote Brian\nMelissa: [action] vote Karen\nBrian: [action] vote Karen\n[Game] Karen was voted out!\n[Game] Entering state: Night_werewolf\n\nTurn #11: [No recent activity]\n\nTurn #12: [Game] Entering state: Night_seer\n\nTurn #13: [Game] Entering state: Night_witch\n\n\nYour available action type(s): [action].\nIt is Night.
