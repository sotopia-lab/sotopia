WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager.

WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'.

WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act.

NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Matthew, Pamela, Thomas, Richard, Nicholas, Kenneth, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Nicholas's) goal: Use save/poison potions strategically to aid villagers.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf.

Let\u2019s get useful info fast. Please give: 1) your top suspect and why, 2) one town read, 3) where you\u2019d vote right now. Seer: only claim if you have a red or you\u2019re about to be executed. Witch: don\u2019t out yourself; no-claim unless absolutely necessary. If there was no night kill, that\u2019s likely a save\u2014still no claims today. Right now I\u2019ve got no hard reads. I\u2019m eyeing the middle (Thomas/Richard/Nicholas) where wolves often coast\u2014prove me wrong with concrete pushes. Pamela, start with a firm suspect. Thomas, name a plausible wolf pair. Richard, commit to a vote with reasons. Nicholas, when would you support a seer claim? Kenneth, as last, don\u2019t just echo\u2014take a clear stance. I\u2019ll vote among the hedgiest/non-committal responses. Let\u2019s build a real consensus and avoid a messy tie.\"\n\nTurn #5: Pamela: said: \"Morning all. Let\u2019s get useful info fast.

That\u2019s low-effort/coasting and avoids staking real reads.\n- Town read: Light town on Matthew for proactively structuring the day without rolefishing.\n- Where I\u2019d vote now: Pamela, pending her giving an original solve.\n\nPlausible wolf pair: Pamela + Richard. If Pamela\u2019s a wolf, a partner who stays theory-only and non-committal fits. Richard, commit now: one concrete scumread and where you\u2019d vote.\n\nNicholas: lay out your seer-claim thresholds (exactly when you\u2019d support a claim). Kenneth: take a stand\u2014top suspect and current vote.\n\nNo death announced so far suggests a save/no-kill; still no claims today. Pamela, please give a firm suspect, a town read, and your current vote target in your own words.\"\n\nTurn #7: Richard: said: \"Morning all. Let\u2019s get useful info fast. Please give: 1) your top suspect and why, 2) one town read, 3) where you\u2019d vote right now. Seer: only claim if you have a red or you\u2019re about to be executed.

It also ignored Thomas\u2019s prompt for original content.\nSecondary: Richard did the same mirror. Two mirrors back-to-back looks like partners trying to slide Day 1.\n\nTown read: Matthew for proactive structure without rolefishing; light town on Thomas for a specific, testable push (Pamela + Richard) and asking for commitments.\n\nWhere I\u2019d vote now: Pamela. I can swap to Richard if Pamela produces substantive, original reads and Richard doesn\u2019t.\n\nQuestions:\n- Pamela: Give 1) your actual top suspect with reasons, 2) one town read with reasons, 3) who you\u2019d vote right now\u2014and explain the mirror.\n- Richard: Same prompt\u2014original content only. Who\u2019s your vote today and why?\n- Kenneth: Don\u2019t echo\u2014stake a top suspect and a current vote preference. We need consensus; no ties.\"\n\nTurn #9: Kenneth: said: \"Here\u2019s my stance, not a mirror: \n- Top suspect: Richard. Pamela\u2019s copy was bad, but Richard mirroring after Thomas already flagged that behavior is worse\u2014reads like a partner trying to coast through the scrutiny. \n- Secondary suspect: Pamela. If Richard gives real, original solving and Pamela stays surface-level, I can flip, but right now Richard > Pamela on timing/awareness. \n- Town read: Matthew for proactive structure without rolefishing; light town on Thomas for the specific Pamela+Richard take and pushing for commitments; Nicholas feels towny for clear seer thresholds and independent reasoning.\n- Where I\u2019d vote now: Richard.\n\nQuestions/next steps:\n- Richard: Give your actual top suspect with reasons and who you\u2019d vote right now. Also explain the mirror after it was already called out.\n- Pamela: Same\u2014original reads and a current vote, please.\n- Matthew/Thomas/Nicholas: Between Richard and Pamela, who do you prefer today? I\u2019m on Richard unless he delivers a strong, original solve and Pamela doesn\u2019t.\n\nMeta: No-kill implies likely save\u2014no claims today unless red result or you\u2019re the leading wagon at EOD.\"\n[Game] Entering state: Day_vote\n\nTurn #10: Matthew: [action] vote Pamela\nPamela: [action] vote Alice\nThomas: [action] vote Pamela\nRichard: [action] vote Alice\nNicholas: [action] vote Richard\nKenneth: [action] vote Richard\n[Game] Pamela was voted out!\n[Game] Entering state: Night_werewolf\n\nTurn #11: [Game] Entering state: Night_seer\n\nTurn #12: [Game] Entering state: Night_witch\n\n\nYour available action type(s): [action].\nIt is Night.
