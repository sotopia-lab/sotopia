GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act.

                    "content": "Imagine you are playing the game as Melissa.\n\nHere is the description of the game: This game is called Werewolves (also known as Mafia), which is a social deduction game.  GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Rebecca, Daniel, Jacob, Helen, Paul, Melissa, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Melissa's) goal: Act openly and collaboratively to identify werewolves.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf. The game begins!\n\nTurn #1: [Game] Entering state: Night_seer\n\nTurn #2: [Game] Entering state: Night_witch\n\nTurn #3: [Game] Rebecca was killed by werewolves!\n[Game] Entering state: Day_discussion\n\nTurn #4: Daniel: said: \"RIP Rebecca. With 5 left we can\u2019t afford a bad execution. Seer: only reveal if you hit a wolf last night; otherwise stay quiet. The kill feels like a safe, low-info choice, which nudges me toward Jacob right now. Jacob, who do you suspect and why? I\u2019m leaning your way unless I hear a strong case elsewhere.\"\n\nTurn #5: Jacob: said: \"I'm leaning your way unless I hear a strong case elsewhere.\"\n\nTurn #6: Helen: said: \"RIP Rebecca. The kill is pretty safe/low-info, so not much to read there. What does stand out is Jacob literally echoing Daniel\u2019s line without adding anything\u2014feels like hedging/buddying the loudest voice to avoid heat. Jacob, who are your top two, and what are your reads on Paul/Melissa? Absent a better case, I\u2019m leaning Jacob. Paul and Melissa, where are you leaning and why?\"\n\nTurn #7: Paul: said: \"I'm leaning Jacob.  Paul and Melissa, where are you leaning and why?\"\n\nTurn #8: Melissa: said: \"I'm looking for a pattern. I need to be very careful about what I say, but I\u2019ll try not to show anyone my thoughts.  I'm going to focus on subtle observations and trying to build a narrative of what's happening. I\u2019ll be cautious about revealing too much information.\"\n[Game] Entering state: Day_vote\n\n\nYour available action type(s): [action].\nIt is voting time. You MUST use the command 'vote NAME' to vote for a player to eliminate. e.g. 'vote Alice'\n\nPlease only generate a JSON string including the action type and the argument.\nYour action should follow the given format:\n{\"properties\": {\"action_type\": {\"const\": \"action\", \"description\": \"whether to speak at this turn or choose to not do anything\", \"title\": \"Action Type\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"argument\": {\"description\": \"the utterance if choose to speak, the expression or gesture if choose non-verbal communication, or the physical action if choose action\", \"title\": \"Argument\", \"type\": \"string\"}}, \"required\": [\"action_type\", \"argument\"], \"title\": \"AgentAction\", \"type\": \"object\"}"
