WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Cynthia, Anthony, Pamela, Barbara, Kimberly, Timothy, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Pamela's) goal: Discreetly inspect players at night to uncover werewolves.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf.

Let's share any suspicions or insights we might have. What does everyone think?\"\n\nTurn #5: Anthony: said: \"The attack was prevented\u2014so someone must be the Witch who saved someone. That means the Werewolves targeted Cynthia, but she\u2019s still alive. I\u2019m suspicious of Barbara since she also killed someone last night\u2014why would a Villager kill Pamela without reason? Maybe Barbara is a Werewolf trying to eliminate suspects. We should vote her out today.\"\n\nTurn #6: Pamela: said: \"\"I agree with Anthony. The fact that an attack was planned against Cynthia indicates that the Werewolves are trying to take out a potential threat. We should definitely consider the possibility that Barbara may be one of them, especially since she seems to have a motive in eliminating me. I suggest we keep a close watch on her and discuss our votes carefully.\"\"\n\nTurn #7: Barbara: said: \"Anthony and Pamela, you're both jumping to conclusions. Just because I killed someone doesn't mean I'm a Werewolf\u2014maybe I was trying to eliminate a threat before the Wolves could. And why would the Werewolves target Cynthia if they knew she was safe? The Witch saved her, so the attack failed. That doesn't point to me\u2014it points to someone trying to misdirect us. I think the real danger is Anthony\u2014he's too eager to pin this on me. Maybe he\u2019s the Seer testing our reactions. Don't fall for his manipulation.\"\n\nTurn #8: Kimberly: said: \"I find Barbara's reasoning very suspicious. While it's true that just because she killed someone doesn't automatically make her a Werewolf, her trying to deflect blame onto Anthony feels like a tactic to distract us. We should carefully consider the possibility that she might be one of the Werewolves. Let's focus on the facts and decide who we believe poses the greatest threat to the village.\"\n\nTurn #9: Timothy: said: \"\"I understand Barbara's perspective, but the fact remains that there was an attack on Cynthia, which indicates a level of threat from the Werewolves. It\u2019s important to consider all angles. I think Anthony may be jumping on Barbara too quickly, but I also see why some are suspicious of her actions. We should focus on analyzing everyone's behaviors to uncover the truth. I suggest we discuss and possibly vote for Barbara today, as her actions seem to be the most controversial right now.
