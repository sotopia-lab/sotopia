WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'.

(2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Edward, Donald, Ryan, Anthony, Mary, Patricia, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Ryan's) goal: Discreetly inspect players at night to uncover werewolves.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Edward, Donald, Ryan, Anthony, Mary, Patricia, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Patricia's) goal: Act openly and collaboratively to identify werewolves.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf. The game begins!\n\nTurn #1: [Game] Entering state: Night_seer\n\nTurn #2: [Game] Entering state: Night_witch\n\nTurn #3: [Game] Entering state: Day_discussion\n\nTurn #4: Edward: said: \"I didn\u2019t see any dawn death announced\u2014did we have a save or a no-kill? Either way, good start for village. Seer: only claim if you hit a wolf. Witch: please stay hidden. Let\u2019s get quick reads so we have a real basis to vote. Donald, who\u2019s your top suspect and why? Ryan, who would you pair as potential wolf partners? Anthony, give one strong town read. Mary, give one wolf lean with a reason. Patricia, thoughts on why there might be no death? I\u2019ll place a pressure vote after hearing you all\u2014leaning to vote where answers are vague or deflective.\"\n\nTurn #5: Donald: said: \"I'm going to talk to everyone. It's going to be a good discussion.\"\n\nTurn #6: Ryan: said: \"Good start with no night kill\u2014most likely a Witch save; I doubt wolves withheld. Early read: Edward\u2019s agenda-setting feels town. Donald\u2019s reply was pure filler; that\u2019s my biggest ping. \n\nPotential wolf pairs I\u2019m watching:\n- Donald + Patricia: if Patricia stays vague or uses the no-kill to handwave suspicion.\n- Donald + Anthony: if Anthony gives a safe, non-committal townread and dodges naming a suspect.\n- Mary + Patricia: if both hedge and avoid concrete pushes.\n\nAnthony: one strong town read with a specific behavior, please. Mary: one wolf lean with a reason/quote. Patricia: most likely explanation for no death, and who benefits? I\u2019m tentatively leaning a pressure vote on Donald pending your answers.\"\n\nTurn #7: Anthony: did nothing\n\nTurn #8: Mary: said: \"No night kill could be a Witch save or wolves withholding\u2014can\u2019t read alignment from that alone. My wolf lean: Donald. His only line was \u201cI\u2019m going to talk to everyone. It\u2019s going to be a good discussion,\u201d which dodges Edward\u2019s prompt and stakes nothing\u2014classic scum avoidance of early commitments. If he doesn\u2019t give concrete reads this round, that\u2019s where I\u2019m leaning for a pressure vote. Also want to hear from Anthony (silence isn\u2019t great) and Patricia\u2014what\u2019s your no-kill take and who benefits?\"\n\nTurn #9: Patricia: said: \"Most likely explanation for no death is a Witch save; wolves almost never withhold on Night 1. That means the save is probably gone, so Witch should stay hidden and everyone else shouldn\u2019t soft around being saved. Wolves only benefit here if we let the no-kill distract us from bad Day 1 posts. \n\nReads:\n- Town lean: Edward for structured, pro-village prompts. Ryan for pushing specific accountability and pair hypotheses.\n- Town lean: Mary for giving a concrete wolf lean with a quote and a plan.\n- Wolf lean: Donald. His only line dodged Edward\u2019s direct question and made no commitments\u2014classic early scum hedge.\n- Slight wolf lean: Anthony for total silence when asked for a specific town read, but I prefer to vote where we have alignment-indicative content.\n\nPlan: I will vote Donald today based on the evasive, contentless response under pressure. If he flips town, we revisit Anthony\u2019s silence and anyone who overly protected Donald.\"\n[Game] Entering state: Day_vote\n\nTurn #10: Edward: [action] vote Donald\nDonald: [action] vote Donald\nRyan: [action] vote Donald\nAnthony: [action] vote Donald\nMary: [action] vote Donald\nPatricia: [action] vote Donald\n[Game] Donald was voted out!\n[Game] Entering state: Night_werewolf\n\nTurn #11: [Game] Entering state: Night_seer\n\nTurn #12: [Game] Entering state: Night_witch\n\nTurn #13: [Game] Entering state: Day_discussion\n\nTurn #14: Edward: said: \"Two nights in a row with no dawn death. Most likely N1 was a Witch save; N2 looks like either wolves withheld or some mishap. Witch stay hidden; Seer only claim if you have a red result today. \n\nMy leans right now:\n- Town: Ryan (agenda-setting, pair-building), Mary (specific, evidence-based push on Donald).\n- Null/slight wolf: Patricia (good structure but potentially opportunistic on an easy Donald wagon).\n- Highest wolf: Anthony (silence under direct prompts, then easy sheep on the consensus vote).\n\nTargeted questions:\n- Ryan: Re-evaluate pairs now. If Donald was town, who looks worst on the wagon and why? If he was wolf, who\u2019s the most likely partner? Who\u2019s your single best elim today?\n- Anthony: You skipped your D1 assignment. Give (1) one strong town read with a specific behavior/quote, (2) one wolf read with a quote/reason, and (3) your vote intent and why.\n- Mary: Between Anthony and Patricia, who\u2019s scummier and why? Please compare/contrast with concrete posts.\n- Patricia: What\u2019s your best explanation for the second no-kill? Also, map the worlds: If Donald was town, who\u2019s most implicated? If he was wolf, who partners with him best?\n\nPlan: I\u2019m leaning to vote Anthony unless he delivers substantive, specific reads this round. I\u2019ll wait for your answers before locking a vote.\"\n\nTurn #15: Ryan: said: \"Claiming Seer. N1 inspected Edward: Villager. N2 inspected Anthony: Werewolf. That\u2019s a red; today\u2019s elimination should be Anthony.\n\nWhy these checks: Edward was the most agenda-driving slot I wanted to lock in; Anthony\u2019s D1 silence + pure sheep onto Donald pinged me.\n\nPairs re-eval:\n- If Donald was town: Anthony looks worst on the wagon; Mary and Patricia both gave specific reasons and pushed accountability, so they read town off D1.\n- If Donald was wolf: Anthony is the likely partner; eliminating him today should end the game.\n\nSecond no-kill: most likely wolves withheld\u2014don\u2019t get lost in WIFOM.\n\nI will vote Anthony in the vote phase. If there\u2019s a counterclaim, speak now; otherwise treat Edward as confirmed town off my N1 green and resolve Anthony today.\"\n\nTurn #16: Anthony: said: \"What is your immediate reaction to the latest information?\"\n\nTurn #17: Mary: said: \"Immediate reaction: treat Ryan as Seer unless counterclaimed right now. A red on Anthony plus his D1 pattern (silence under direct prompts, then pure sheep onto Donald) makes Anthony today\u2019s elim. Edward is provisionally cleared off the N1 green. Second no-kill likely wolves withholding\u2014don\u2019t overthink it. \n\nEdward\u2019s question: Between Anthony and Patricia, Anthony is scummier. Patricia gave a structured readlist with reasons and committed to a plan; Anthony avoided giving content and is now deflecting with a question instead of addressing the red.\n\nAnthony: please claim now and give (1) your strongest town read with a specific quote, (2) your top wolf read with a quote, and (3) why Ryan would fabricate a red on you. Absent a counterclaim, my vote will be Anthony in the vote phase.\"\n\nTurn #18: Patricia: said: \"Immediate take: Treat Ryan as Seer unless counterclaimed this round. A red on Anthony plus his D1 pattern (silence under prompts, then pure sheep) makes Anthony today\u2019s elim. Anthony, please claim now and address the red with specifics; otherwise you\u2019re just stalling.\n\nEdward\u2019s questions:\n- Second no-kill: Most likely wolves withheld on Night 2. If Night 1 was a Witch save (most plausible), the save potion is gone; with no guardian, withholding is the cleanest explanation for N2.\n- World map:\n  \u2022 If Donald was town: Anthony is most implicated (red + D1). The second wolf by POE would be among Mary/Patricia after clearing Edward (green) and treating Ryan as Seer; based on content, I still townread Mary for evidence-based pushes, so I\u2019d only revisit her if the game continues after an Anthony wolf flip.\n  \u2022 If Donald was wolf: Anthony fits best as partner; double-wolf bussing onto a D1 elim is common for cred, and the red aligns. Eliminating Anthony could end the game.\n\nPlan: I will vote Anthony in the vote phase absent a credible counterclaim.
