WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone.

WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Joseph, Michelle, Matthew, Lisa, Margaret, Joshua, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Margaret's) goal: Use save/poison potions strategically to aid villagers.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf.

I'm Joseph. I heard the attack was prevented\u2014so the Witch must have saved someone tonight. That\u2019s a good sign for our side! Let\u2019s think: who was targeted? Since the Witch saved someone, they likely saw a threat. I\u2019m going to assume the Werewolves targeted someone suspicious. Michelle, Matthew, Lisa, Margaret, Joshua\u2014I\u2019m open to all theories. Let\u2019s share what we saw or felt during the night. No one can act now, so let\u2019s be honest and collaborative. Who do you think is lying or acting odd?\"\n\nTurn #5: Michelle: said: \"Morning all. Great that the attack was stopped. Witch, please don\u2019t reveal yourself; if you used a save, keep that to yourself for now. Seer should also stay quiet unless you have a hard wolf. Joseph, small note: wolves usually try to kill someone who reads very towny or power, not someone \u201csuspicious,\u201d so that framing pings me a bit\u2014nothing huge yet. I want to hear stances: Matthew and Lisa, who would you vote right now and why? Margaret and Joshua, give one solid town read and one suspect. Very light lean on Joseph (wording) and a soft eye on Joshua pending what he says, but I\u2019ll adjust after everyone speaks.\"\n\nTurn #6: Matthew: said: \"Thanks, Michelle. I agree the Witch\u2019s save is a good sign\u2014means we\u2019re still in this. Joseph, your point about wolves targeting the \u2018suspicious\u2019 feels off; that\u2019s exactly what a wolf would say to redirect blame. I didn\u2019t see anything at night, but I\u2019m suspicious of anyone over-explaining or trying to steer the conversation. Joshua, your name came up twice now\u2014what\u2019s your take? And Lisa, Margaret\u2014I\u2019d love to hear your early reads. Let\u2019s keep it grounded.\"\n\nTurn #7: Lisa: said: \"Morning. Glad the kill got stopped, but quick mechanics note: the Witch only knows a kill happened and who it was on, not alignment\u2014so we shouldn\u2019t read too much into why they saved. Joseph, your take that wolves would target someone \u201csuspicious\u201d feels off; wolves usually hunt strong town or perceived PRs. That reads like gentle narrative-setting. If I had to vote right now, it\u2019d be Joseph. Light town leans: Michelle for pushing useful structure and discouraging PR claims, and Matthew\u2019s tone feels grounded. Margaret, can you give one solid town read and one suspect plus where you\u2019d vote? Joshua, you\u2019ve been pinged\u2014give us your strongest read and who you\u2019d eliminate today. I can pivot if either of you presents something compelling, but Joseph is my current pick.\"\n\nTurn #8: Margaret: said: \"Thanks, Lisa and Matthew. I agree the Witch saved Matthew\u2014maybe because he\u2019s a key town player or just lucky. Joseph, your framing about wolves targeting the \u2018suspicious\u2019 does feel off\u2014it\u2019s too textbook. Michelle, you\u2019re right to caution against overreading the Witch\u2019s move, but your redirect to Joshua feels like a subtle deflection. I\u2019m not convinced by Joseph\u2019s initial analysis, and Matthew\u2019s grounded tone is reassuring. My vote today? Joseph. He\u2019s trying to shape the narrative too early, and that\u2019s a classic wolf tactic. Let\u2019s keep the focus on him.\"\n\nTurn #9: Joshua: said: \"Thanks for the insights, everyone.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Joseph, Michelle, Matthew, Lisa, Margaret, Joshua, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Matthew's) goal: Discreetly inspect players at night to uncover werewolves.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf.
