WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager.

NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager.

NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Dorothy, Jennifer, Andrew, Robert, Brandon, Rebecca, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Rebecca's) goal: Act openly and collaboratively to identify werewolves.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf.

We should vote him out.\"\n\nTurn #5: Andrew: said: \"Dorothy was killed by the werewolves, which is consistent with wolf behavior. Robert's calmness is concerning, but we should be careful not to jump to conclusions. I don't have any direct evidence against him, but I do suspect that someone else might be hiding. I'd like to see more information before voting.\"\n\nTurn #6: Robert: said: \"Jennifer is trying to shift blame onto me because she\u2019s the one who initiated the kill. If I were a werewolf, why would I kill her in the same night? That doesn\u2019t make sense\u2014she\u2019s trying to eliminate a threat. Andrew is right to be cautious. We need more information before voting someone out.\"\n\nTurn #7: Brandon: said: \"Robert's explanation makes sense, but I'm not convinced he's fully honest. He claims he wouldn't kill Jennifer, but we don't know if that's true\u2014werewolves can always act in ways that seem logical to others. I think we should keep an open mind and avoid rushing to vote. Let's look at the next night's developments to gather more clues.\"\n\nTurn #8: Rebecca: said: \"I agree with Andrew and Brandon that we should be cautious about voting anyone out. Robert's explanation about not killing Jennifer makes sense, but we can't fully trust that. As a villager, I believe we need to keep the discussion open and focus on gathering more information from the next night's events.
