WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone.

Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Betty, Michelle, Donald, George, Lisa, Rebecca, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Donald's) goal: Discreetly inspect players at night to uncover werewolves.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf.

This suggests that the Witch may have saved someone. I wonder if we should start by figuring out who could be a werewolf. Does anyone have any strong suspicions or insights?\"\n\nTurn #5: Michelle: said: \"The attack was prevented, so the Witch saved someone\u2014but we don\u2019t know who. That means either Donald or Betty was targeted. Since I was the one who killed Betty, and George also targeted Donald, it\u2019s suspicious that both of them went for the same two people. Maybe one of us is a Werewolf trying to frame the other? I think George is acting too aggressively. He killed Donald right after me\u2014too coordinated. I suspect he\u2019s a Werewolf.\"\n\nTurn #6: Donald: said: \"I agree with Michelle that George's behavior seems suspicious, but we should also consider all possibilities. The Witch preventing the attack makes it hard to pinpoint anything. I wish we could be sure of who the target was. We might actually have to consider if either Betty or I could have been playfully roped into this whole scheme. It's essential we keep looking at each other's actions closely.\"\n\nTurn #7: George: said: \"Michelle is trying to point the finger at me because she killed Betty and now wants to shift blame. But if I were a Werewolf, why would I kill Donald\u2014someone who\u2019s already under suspicion? That makes no sense. The real threat is Michelle: she targeted Betty first, then immediately tried to frame me. She\u2019s acting too confident, like she\u2019s trying to control the narrative. The Witch saved someone\u2014but maybe that someone was Donald? And now Michelle is using that to paint me as the villain. I think we should vote out Michelle before she gets another chance to manipulate us.\"\n\nTurn #8: Lisa: said: \"\"I see a lot of accusations flying around, but we need to focus on facts. Firstly, the Witch saved one of us, and we don't know if that was Donald or Betty. George, your reasoning seems to hinge on the assumption that if you were a Werewolf, targeting Donald would be illogical. However, Werewolves can act unpredictably. Let\u2019s not forget Michelle's point about the coordination of actions\u2014both you and her targeted similar victims which can indicate a specific strategy. I think we should investigate further before making a rash decision. I want to hear more thoughts on the Witch's influence, and perhaps instead of jumping to votes, we should discuss potential strategies or suspicions regarding werewolves.\"\n\nTurn #9: Rebecca: said: \"\"I agree with Lisa that we need to take a step back and carefully analyze our options before jumping to conclusions. George, your point about Michelle's confidence is interesting, but we can't overlook the possibility that you may also be trying to deflect suspicion away from yourself. Both of you had the opportunity to target the same players last night, which raises flags on both sides. I think we should consider how each of us is acting rather than pushing for immediate votes.

WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act.
