WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone.

Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed.

NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public.

DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Donna, Paul, Christopher, Kevin, Lisa, David, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (David's) goal: Act openly and collaboratively to identify werewolves.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf. The game begins!\n\nTurn #1: [Game] Entering state: Night_seer\n\nTurn #2: [Game] Entering state: Night_witch\n\nTurn #3: [Game] Christopher was killed by werewolves!\n[Game] Entering state: Day_discussion\n\nTurn #4: Donna: said: \"{'output': 'Yes, I think he is a werewolf.'}\"\n\nTurn #5: Paul: said: \"I'm surprised Christopher was killed\u2014he seemed like a solid villager. Donna, you immediately said he's a werewolf without any evidence. That\u2019s suspicious. Why so quick to point fingers? Maybe you're trying to redirect attention.\"\n\nTurn #6: Kevin: said: \"Paul has a point\u2014I also found Donna\u2019s instant accusation odd. Christopher was just killed, and she didn\u2019t even pause to think. That\u2019s not the behavior of a villager trying to find the truth. Maybe she\u2019s covering for something. I\u2019m not convinced Paul is guilty yet\u2014he\u2019s questioning the rush to judgment, which sounds more like a villager trying to stay calm.\"\n\nTurn #7: Lisa: said: \"{'output': 'Yes, I think he is a werewolf.'}\"\n\nTurn #8: David: said: \"{'output': 'Yes, I think he is a werewolf.'}\"\n[Game] Entering state: Day_vote\n\n\nYour available action type(s): [action].\nIt is voting time. You MUST use the command 'vote NAME' to vote for a player to eliminate. e.g. 'vote Alice'\n\nPlease only generate a JSON string including the action type and the argument.\nYour action should follow the given format:\n{\"properties\": {\"action_type\": {\"const\": \"action\", \"description\": \"whether to speak at this turn or choose to not do anything\", \"title\": \"Action Type\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"argument\": {\"description\": \"the utterance if choose to speak, the expression or gesture if choose non-verbal communication, or the physical action if choose action\", \"title\": \"Argument\", \"type\": \"string\"}}, \"required\": [\"action_type\", \"argument\"], \"title\": \"AgentAction\", \"type\": \"object\"}"
                }
            ],
            "response": "{\"action_type\": \"action\", \"argument\": \"{'output': 'Yes, I think he is a werewolf.'}\"}"
        }
    ]
