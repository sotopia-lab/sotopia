GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public.

WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public.

DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Ashley, Larry, Helen, Richard, Michelle, Jason, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Helen's) goal: Discreetly inspect players at night to uncover werewolves.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf. The game begins!\n\nTurn #1: [Game] Entering state: Night_seer\n\nTurn #2: Helen: [action] inspect Ashley\n[Private to Helen] Ashley is on team: Villagers\n[Game] Entering state: Night_witch\n\nTurn #3: [Game] An attack was prevented!\n[Game] Entering state: Day_discussion\n\nTurn #4: Ashley: said: \"No death last night\u2014\u2018attack prevented\u2019 means wolves tried and the Witch saved, so the save is gone. With 6 alive and 2 wolves, a wrong execution today likely loses us the game, so we need to hit a wolf. Seer: if you inspected a wolf, please claim now with the name; if you saw a villager, stay quiet. Witch: do not claim. Everyone: give your top 1\u20132 suspects with reasons and who you\u2019d vote right now; avoid rushing, and let\u2019s consolidate\u2014no split votes. Also, no one should claim they were attacked (you wouldn\u2019t know under these rules). Larry, you\u2019re up\u2014who\u2019s your best vote and why?\"\n\nTurn #5: Larry: said: \"Ashley makes a good point\u2014no one died, so the Witch saved someone. That means the Wolves targeted someone, and the save is gone. Since Richard and I both voted to kill last night (I killed Helen, he killed Ashley), it\u2019s clear we\u2019re not both villagers. I\u2019m not the Seer\u2014I didn\u2019t inspect anyone\u2014but here\u2019s what I think: Richard is acting too calm, too quick to push for a wolf kill. He\u2019s trying to steer us away from himself. I\u2019m voting Richard today\u2014he\u2019s our best bet. If he\u2019s a Wolf, we remove one. If he\u2019s not\u2026 well, then the Seer better step up and prove it.\"\n\nTurn #6: Helen: said: \"Agree with Ashley: no death likely means the Witch used the save, and we should only see a Seer claim if they hit a wolf. Larry, your statement that 'since Richard and I both voted to kill last night (I killed Helen, he killed Ashley)' is information a villager cannot have. Only wolves submit/see kill choices. Either you slipped with TMI or you're fabricating it to shade Richard. That makes you my top suspect by a lot. The 'Richard is too calm' reason is also weak. Absent a convincing explanation, I plan to vote Larry. Ashley feels towny for process. Michelle and Jason, thoughts on Larry's claim?\"\n\nTurn #7: Richard: said: \"Helen, you\u2019re right that I shouldn\u2019t know who the wolves targeted\u2014only wolves do. But Larry didn\u2019t say he knew who was killed; he just said he and I both *voted* to kill last night. That\u2019s public knowledge from the Night_werewolf phase\u2014everyone knows who voted to kill, even if they don\u2019t know the outcome. I voted Ashley because she was too quick to assume the Witch saved someone and started directing the game. That\u2019s suspicious behavior for a villager. Larry\u2019s claim about my calmness is weak, but his accusation that he revealed wolf knowledge? That\u2019s backwards\u2014he\u2019s the one who said 'I killed Helen'\u2014that\u2019s not something a villager should say. He\u2019s trying to frame me by pretending he knows more than he should. I\u2019m not the Seer, but if you\u2019re looking for the real wolf, look at who\u2019s trying to control the narrative. I\u2019m voting Larry.\"\n\nTurn #8: Michelle: said: \"Two big red flags: (1) Larry saying \u201cI killed Helen, he killed Ashley\u201d is a wolf-only perspective\u2014villagers don\u2019t make night kill votes. That\u2019s a slip. (2) Richard\u2019s claim that those night kill votes were public is incorrect by the rules and looks like cover. I\u2019m most comfortable executing Larry today; Richard is my second choice. Seer should only claim if you have a wolf result. Jason, where are you? I\u2019m ready to consolidate on Larry.\"\n\nTurn #9: Jason: said: \"I\u2019m with Ashley/Helen/Michelle: \u201cattack prevented\u201d means the Witch saved and the save is gone\u2014today is must-hit. Larry\u2019s line \u201cI killed Helen, he killed Ashley\u201d is a wolf-only perspective; villagers don\u2019t make night kill votes. That\u2019s the clearest alignment slip we have, so Larry is my top vote. Richard\u2019s defense that those night votes were public is incorrect by the rules and looks like cover\u2014he\u2019s my #2 and likely partner if Larry flips wolf. Townleans: Ashley for solid process, Helen for catching the slip, Michelle for clear reasoning. Seer should only claim with a wolf result; since no one claimed, stay hidden.

(2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager.
