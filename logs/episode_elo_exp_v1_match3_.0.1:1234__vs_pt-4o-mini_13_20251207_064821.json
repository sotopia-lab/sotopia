WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Stephanie, Mary, Linda, Amanda, Carol, Margaret, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Linda's) goal: Discreetly inspect players at night to uncover werewolves.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf.

This could mean that either the witch saved someone or there was some other intervention. Let's discuss who we suspect might be a werewolf. I feel like we should pinpoint our suspicions and work together to find out who among us is not a villager. What does everyone think?\"\n\nTurn #5: Mary: said: \"The attack being prevented is suspicious\u2014why would the witch save someone unless they were targeted? Linda was killed, but the attack was blocked... that means someone else was meant to die. I think Amanda is trying to frame us by killing Stephanie, but the witch saved her instead. We should vote out Amanda\u2014she\u2019s acting too aggressively.\"\n\nTurn #6: Linda: said: \"I agree with Stephanie that we need to discuss our suspicions. I\u2019m not sure about Amanda, but I think we should focus on gathering more information before making any rash decisions. Keeping an open dialogue is crucial.

That doesn\u2019t make me guilty; it makes her lucky. Linda\u2019s right\u2014we need more info before pointing fingers. If I were a werewolf, why would I kill Stephanie and risk exposing myself? I think Mary\u2019s too eager to blame someone. Maybe she\u2019s trying to divert attention.\"\n\nTurn #8: Carol: said: \"I think it's essential we stay level-headed here. Mary, while your suspicions about Amanda might seem valid, it\u2019s important to remember we don't have concrete evidence against her yet. We should focus on the fact that whoever the attacker was, they targeted someone significant, and the witch acted wisely by saving Linda last night. Instead of jumping into accusations, let's think about who still hasn\u2019t spoken much and analyze their behavior. I propose we keep an open discussion before we decide on a vote.\"\n\nTurn #9: Margaret: said: \"I understand everyone's concerns, and I agree with the need for more dialogue. Amanda, while your point about not exposing yourself is valid, it's also important that we don't overlook the way Mary raises her suspicions. We shouldn't jump to conclusions without considering that the witch might have had a good reason to act. I suggest we also reflect on Stephanie\u2019s perspective; her input could be key. We need to make our accusations backed by thought, so let's keep this conversation going and examine each person's actions critically.\"\n[Game] Entering state: Day_vote\n\nTurn #10: Stephanie: [action] vote Amanda\nMary: [action] vote Amanda\nLinda: [action] vote Amanda\nAmanda: [action] vote Mary\nCarol: [action] vote Mary\nMargaret: [action] vote Amanda\n[Game] Amanda was voted out!\n[Game] Entering state: Night_werewolf\n\nTurn #11: [Game] Entering state: Night_seer\n\n\nYour available action type(s): [action].\nIt is Night.
