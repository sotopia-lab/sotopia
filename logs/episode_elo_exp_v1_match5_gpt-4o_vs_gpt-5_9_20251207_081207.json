GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'.

WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public.

I\u2019m feeling a bit more trusting towards Justin too, mainly due to the solid plan proposal.\n\nAt the moment, I'm watching Linda and Steven, but I\u2019d like to hear a bit more from Stephen before making a final decision.

Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public.

Important: the saved target is confirmed non-wolf (wolves can only target villagers), but only the Witch knows who that is.\n\nPlan:\n- Seer: Only claim if you inspected a Werewolf. If you saw a villager, stay hidden and keep scanning.\n- Witch: Don\u2019t reveal now. If today\u2019s wagon lands on the person you saved, please out and clear them to prevent a mis-elim. Keep poison for a confident hit if needed.\n- Everyone: Give one suspect, one lighter read, and who you intend to vote with a short reason.

Last night's save was indeed fortunate, and I'm finding myself in a tricky spot without firm information from the Seer yet. I did notice Steven seemed quite eager to draw attention away from himself during the last discussion, and that felt a bit suspicious to me.\n\nFor a lighter read, I found Daniel's silence a bit intriguing, maybe over-cautious? I'll keep my eyes on both of them for now.\n\nWhen it comes to voting, I'll lean towards Steven based on this suspicion unless further information emerges during discussions.

I\u2019d like specifics. \n\nReads:\n- Suspect: Linda for a vague/possibly inaccurate push on Steven and a pre-committed vote without substance.\n- Light town: Justin for a structured plan that advances village win conditions and sets clear accountability.\n\nI want to hear from Jennifer, Steven, and Stephen, but my vote is likely Linda unless she substantiates her claim. Steven, please respond to Linda\u2019s point directly. Jennifer and Stephen, where are you leaning?\"\n\nTurn #7: Jennifer: said: \"Good morning everyone. I have to agree with Daniel here; it\u2019s early days to draw conclusions on silence when we\u2019re just getting started. Linda\u2019s quick charge and pre-commitment to vote for Steven without clearer reasoning is intriguing. \n\nFor what it's worth, I'm inclined to view Linda's actions as hasty, but I'm not sure if that makes her a wolf or just an overzealous villager. I\u2019m feeling a bit more trusting towards Justin too, mainly due to the solid plan proposal.\n\nAt the moment, I'm watching Linda and Steven, but I\u2019d like to hear a bit more from Stephen before making a final decision. It's crucial we tread carefully this vote. Curious to see how Steven responds too. \n\nHow about you, Stephen?\"\n\nTurn #8: Steven: said: \"Linda, that push on me doesn\u2019t track: there was no prior discussion for me to be \u201ceager to draw attention away\u201d from.

Pre-committing to vote me at LYLO without specifics looks like manufacturing a wagon.\n\nReads:\n- Suspect: Linda for misrep + anchoring a vote early.\n- Townleans: Justin for a plan that helps town and sets accountability; Daniel for precise, solving-focused pressure.\n- Light town: Jennifer for measured, open-minded approach.\n- Need to hear from: Stephen.\n\nPlan: With 6 alive and 2 wolves, we cannot mis-eliminate. Seer should only claim if you have a wolf. I\u2019m not voting Justin today. My vote is likely Linda unless Stephen brings something compelling or Linda substantiates her case.

Townlean.\n- Steven: Direct, consistent, and laid out stances with accountability. Slight townlean.\n- Jennifer: Measured and open to reevaluation. Light town.\n- Justin: My top suspect. He set the stage with a plan that pressures hedging but didn\u2019t name a suspect himself (asking everyone else to commit while he stays flexible).
