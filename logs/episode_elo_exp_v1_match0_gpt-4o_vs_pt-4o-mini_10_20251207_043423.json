GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act.

WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Sandra, Jeffrey, Mary, Thomas, George, Sharon, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Sharon's) goal: Act openly and collaboratively to identify werewolves.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf.

Let's discuss who we think the werewolves might be based on our observations. Jeffrey, Mary, Thomas, George, what are your thoughts?\"\n\nTurn #5: Jeffrey: said: \"It\u2019s great to hear the attack was stopped. Definitely agree it\u2019s a good sign for us villagers. Well, I haven\u2019t seen much suspicious activity from anyone in particular, though we should be cautious about pointing fingers too quickly. Perhaps we should hear what everyone else has to say and see if anyone noticed anything suspicious during last night or has other thoughts on who might be a threat.\"\n\nTurn #6: Mary: said: \"I agree with both of you that it's great the attack was prevented. I inspected Sandra last night, and she is confirmed to be a Villager. We should focus our suspicions elsewhere. Thomas and George, did either of you notice anything unusual last night?\"\n\nTurn #7: Thomas: said: \"I also think it's great news that the attack was stopped last night! Mary, it's reassuring to hear about Sandra's confirmation. Well, from my perspective, I didn't notice anything particularly unusual, except maybe Jeffrey seemed a bit nervous during the night. It could mean nothing, though; he could just naturally be on edge. I'm open to hearing more observations from everyone else, especially any insights that could help narrow down the suspects.\"\n\nTurn #8: George: said: \"I appreciate everyone sharing their thoughts. It's reassuring that we have some confirmed Villagers. However, I want to bring attention to the fact that Thomas mentioned he noticed Jeffrey being a bit nervous. Nervousness can be a sign of hiding something. I think we should keep a close eye on Jeffrey as we move forward and consider discussing him further.\"\n\nTurn #9: Sharon: said: \"I appreciate all of your insights so far. I agree with George's point about keeping an eye on Jeffrey, especially since Thomas picked up on his nervousness. However, at this early stage, it's important we don't act too hastily. I also want to address that Mary has confirmed Sandra as a Villager, which is very helpful.
