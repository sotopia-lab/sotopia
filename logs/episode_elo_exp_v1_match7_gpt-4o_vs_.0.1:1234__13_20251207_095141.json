GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Jennifer, Angela, Carol, Jacob, Margaret, Brenda, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Brenda's) goal: Act openly and collaboratively to identify werewolves.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf. The game begins!\n\nTurn #1: [Game] Entering state: Night_seer\n\nTurn #2: [Game] Entering state: Night_witch\n\nTurn #3: [Game] Margaret was killed by werewolves!\n[Game] Entering state: Day_discussion\n\nTurn #4: Jennifer: said: \"Margaret was killed tonight, which means the werewolves have struck early. I'm concerned because she was a calm and trustworthy player. Let's all think carefully\u2014anyone notice suspicious behavior during the night or in previous rounds? We need to work together to find the wolves before more of us are lost.\"\n\nTurn #5: Angela: said: \"\"This is devastating. Margaret was always keen on spotting details that others might miss. Last night, I was really uneasy, though didn't hear or notice much, to be honest. But we have to be methodical about this. Maybe someone else heard something peculiar or unusual? Let's piece this together.\"\"\n\nTurn #6: Carol: said: \"Margaret's death is a big loss\u2014she seemed reliable. Jennifer and Angela both mentioned being uneasy, but no one has pointed to anyone specific yet. I\u2019m concerned because the werewolves struck fast, which suggests they know who to target. Let\u2019s pay close attention to who seems too eager to deflect blame or avoids answering direct questions. I\u2019m keeping my eyes open.\"\n\nTurn #7: Jacob: said: \"The loss of Margaret is definitely a setback, considering how insightful she's been in past rounds. However, I think we need to consider any alliances she might have formed recently. Could there be someone overly saddened by her loss to throw off suspicion? It\u2019s hard to say at this point, but I suggest we note how people act under pressure, especially those already shifting attention toward others. Perhaps there's a lead buried in the patterns of our discussions or the hesitation in decisions. Let's not rule out anyone, no matter how honest they might appear.\"\n\nTurn #8: Brenda: said: \"Margaret's death is a shock, and I agree with everyone that we need to be careful and methodical. I\u2019m not pointing fingers yet, but I notice we\u2019re all expressing concern\u2014this is good. Let\u2019s focus on who hasn\u2019t offered any concrete observation or seems to be avoiding the topic.
