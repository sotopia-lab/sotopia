GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Kathleen, Michael, Gary, Christopher, Sharon, Jessica, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Sharon's) goal: Use save/poison potions strategically to aid villagers.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf.

No death last night\u2014likely the Witch used the one-time save, so we probably have no protection now. Seer: only claim today if you inspected a Werewolf; if you only saw a Villager, please stay hidden and keep gathering info. Witch: do not claim; hold poison for a strong, confident read. For this round, please give 1 suspect and 1 townlean with a short reason, and say whether you\u2019d follow a Seer-called wolf instantly (I would). I\u2019ll be watching for hedging and opportunism. Michael, who pings you first? Gary, same question. Christopher, would you vote a Seer-called wolf without hesitation? Sharon, if no claim appears, who\u2019s your best pressure vote? Jessica, where should we focus if we get no info claim?\"\n\nTurn #5: Michael: said: \"Good morning, Kathleen. I\u2019m surprised no one died\u2014Witch must\u2019ve saved someone. Since Gary and Christopher both targeted each other, that\u2019s suspicious: one of them is likely a Werewolf trying to create chaos. I\u2019m leaning toward Christopher as the bigger threat\u2014he went for Gary, who\u2019s probably innocent given how he was targeted. I\u2019d follow a Seer if they claimed a wolf, but until then, Christopher is my top suspect. Gary, you\u2019re lucky you got saved\u2014but why did you go for Chris? Something\u2019s off.\"\n\nTurn #6: Gary: said: \"Claiming Seer. I inspected Michael last night: he is a Werewolf. Please vote Michael today. Kathleen is a townlean for her structured plan and correct Seer guidance. Michael\u2019s story about \u201cGary and Christopher targeting each other\u201d is invented\u2014there was no prior day action to base that on. If anyone counterclaims Seer, do it now; otherwise we snap Michael. Witch, don\u2019t out; hold poison unless we miss today. Christopher/Sharon/Jessica\u2014will you follow this Seer-called wolf?\"\n\nTurn #7: Christopher: said: \"Gary claims to be Seer and says he inspected Michael. That\u2019s convenient\u2014why didn\u2019t he speak up earlier? And why target Michael now, right after I killed Gary? That\u2019s too perfect.
