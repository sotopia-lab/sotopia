WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Justin, Anthony, Margaret, Laura, Edward, Jonathan, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Jonathan's) goal: Act openly and collaboratively to identify werewolves.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf. The game begins!\n\nTurn #1: [Game] Entering state: Night_seer\n\nTurn #2: [Game] Entering state: Night_witch\n\nTurn #3: [Game] Justin was killed by werewolves!\n[Game] Entering state: Day_discussion\n\nTurn #4: Anthony: said: \"Justin was killed by the werewolves, but I'm not sure who to trust yet. Laura just killed Margaret\u2014was that a coincidence? Or is she trying to frame someone? I think we need to be careful and watch everyone closely. Margaret was a villager, right? So now we're down to five players\u2014two werewolves, one seer, one witch, and two villagers. I don't think I'm a werewolf, but I won\u2019t say who I am. Let\u2019s hear what everyone has to say before we vote.\"\n\nTurn #5: Margaret: said: \"What do you think about the situation? Please share your thoughts and suspicions.  I'm looking for clues in their words and actions.\"\n\nTurn #6: Laura: said: \"I'm shocked Justin is gone\u2014was he really a villager? Anthony claims he's not a werewolf, but why did he kill first? And now I killed Margaret... but that was to protect the group. She seemed too eager to ask for opinions\u2014maybe she's trying to manipulate us. I think Anthony is the real threat here\u2014he\u2019s controlling the narrative. Let's vote him out before he kills again.\"\n\nTurn #7: Edward: said: \"I think Margaret's actions are suspicious. Her insistence on asking for opinions and her seemingly calculated moves suggest she might be attempting to manipulate us. I'm leaning towards her being the manipulator.\"\n\nTurn #8: Jonathan: said: \"\u201cI think Margaret\u2019s actions are suspicious. Please share your thoughts and suspicions.\u201d\"\n[Game] Entering state: Day_vote\n\nTurn #9: Anthony: [action] vote Laura\nMargaret: [action] vote\nLaura: [action] vote Anthony\nEdward: [action] vote\nJonathan: [action] vote NAME\n[Game] Laura was voted out!\n[Game] Entering state: Night_werewolf\n\nTurn #10: [Game] Entering state: Night_seer\n\nTurn #11: [Game] Entering state: Night_witch\n\nTurn #12: [Game] Edward was killed by werewolves!\n[Game] Entering state: Day_discussion\n\nTurn #13: Anthony: said: \"Edward is dead now, and Laura\u2019s gone too. That leaves just me, Margaret, and Jonathan. I\u2019m still not sure who to trust\u2014Margaret keeps pushing for opinions like she\u2019s fishing for information, and Jonathan hasn\u2019t said anything meaningful yet. If I\u2019m the only one left who\u2019s not screaming for votes, maybe that makes me look guilty\u2026 or maybe it just means I\u2019m the smartest one here. Let\u2019s hear from Margaret and Jonathan\u2014what do you two really know?\"\n\nTurn #14: Margaret: said: \"What do you think about the situation? Please share your thoughts and suspicions. I'm looking for clues in their words and actions.\"\n\nTurn #15: Jonathan: said: \"Please share your thoughts and suspicions.\"\n[Game] Entering state: Day_vote\n\n\nYour available action type(s): [action].\nIt is voting time.
