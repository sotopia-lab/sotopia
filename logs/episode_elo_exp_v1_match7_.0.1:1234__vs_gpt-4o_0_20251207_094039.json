GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act.

WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Matthew, Betty, Lisa, Linda, Andrew, Kimberly, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Betty's) goal: Deceive others, avoid detection, and eliminate villagers.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf.

It seems like no one was killed last night, which might mean the Witch used their save potion. This is good news for us villagers, but we need to be careful as the Werewolves will try again tonight. I suggest we start discussing any suspicious behavior we noticed from each other during the previous day. Let's collaborate and be open with our thoughts so we can pinpoint any potential Werewolves. What does everyone think?\"\n\nTurn #5: Betty: said: \"Good morning, Matthew. I agree that no death means the Witch saved someone\u2014but who did they save? Lisa or Linda both targeted you, so maybe the Witch saved you to protect a villager. But why would two people target you? That\u2019s suspicious. I think one of them is a Werewolf, and we should vote someone out today to be safe.\"\n\nTurn #6: Lisa: said: \"I understand the suspicion, Betty, but we should be cautious before jumping to conclusions. I can confirm that Matthew is a villager, as I inspected him last night. It seems the Witch made a wise decision to save him. We should focus on gathering more information during today's discussion. Perhaps Kimberly or Andrew might provide more insights or observations from last night?\"\n\nTurn #7: Linda: said: \"Lisa claims she inspected Matthew, but that\u2019s impossible\u2014only the Seer can inspect players, and we don\u2019t know who the Seer is yet. This feels like a lie to protect someone. I\u2019m suspicious of Lisa. Betty, your suspicion about me and Lisa targeting Matthew is valid\u2014I didn\u2019t know who the Seer was, but if Lisa\u2019s telling the truth about inspecting him, then she\u2019s either the Seer or lying to manipulate us. Either way, she\u2019s dangerous. I vote Lisa today.\"\n\nTurn #8: Andrew: said: \"I think it's crucial that we remain level-headed and don't act hastily. I saved Matthew last night because I had a strong feeling he was being targeted, given how vocal and helpful he\u2019s been during discussions. Whether Lisa is truly the Seer or not will become clearer soon, but I lean towards believing her since her claim aligns with my action last night. However, Linda did bring up a valid point about Lisa's claim that we should consider. Let's use this discussion phase to analyze evidence carefully before we make any final voting decisions. It's our best chance to take out a Werewolf. Let's hear from Kimberly and get everyone's input before we decide.\"\n\nTurn #9: Kimberly: said: \"I appreciate hearing everyone's thoughts, and I'm taking note of the key points being raised. Matthew, it was beneficial to hear you were saved by the Witch, and thank you, Andrew, for confirming your action. That's a helpful confirmation.\n\nRegarding Lisa's claim, if she truly is the Seer and has verified Matthew as a villager, it does give us one less person to be suspicious of, at least in my opinion. But I understand the need for caution because revealing the true Seer could put them in danger.\n\nLinda\u2019s skepticism about Lisa also brings a valid concern if Lisa is bluffing as the Seer\u2014this could be a powerful move by a Werewolf.\n\nI suggest we focus on coordinating our alignment with logical deductions and verifying each claim step by step to make a well-informed decision.
