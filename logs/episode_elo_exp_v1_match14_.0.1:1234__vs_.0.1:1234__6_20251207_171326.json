WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act.

WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'.

WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed.

WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'.

WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Brenda, Elizabeth, Kimberly, Nicole, Richard, Scott, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Kimberly's) goal: Discreetly inspect players at night to uncover werewolves.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf. The game begins!\n\nTurn #1: [Game] Entering state: Night_seer\n\nTurn #2: Kimberly: [action] inspect Brenda\n[Private to Kimberly] Brenda is on team: Villagers\n[Game] Entering state: Night_witch\n\nTurn #3: [Game] An attack was prevented!\n[Game] Entering state: Day_discussion\n\nTurn #4: Brenda: said: \"I'm glad the attack was prevented\u2014thank you, Witch! This means someone is still alive who might be crucial. Let\u2019s think: Who could have been targeted? Since the Witch saved someone, it\u2019s likely they were trying to protect an innocent. I\u2019m suspicious of anyone who seemed too quiet or tried to redirect attention. Let\u2019s hear everyone\u2019s thoughts\u2014Elizabeth, you\u2019re next. What did you notice last night?\"\n\nTurn #5: Elizabeth: said: \"I didn't notice anything unusual last night\u2014Nicole was the one who was targeted, and I'm not sure why that would be suspicious. I trust the Witch's judgment to protect the innocent. I think we should focus on who might have been trying to manipulate the discussion. Maybe someone is trying to shift blame or create false leads. But I don't have any concrete evidence against anyone.\"\n\nTurn #6: Kimberly: said: \"I appreciate the Witch\u2019s intervention\u2014it\u2019s a relief we lost no one. But I\u2019m curious: why did Elizabeth say Nicole was targeted? No one died, so the Witch must have saved someone before the attack took effect. That means the Werewolves targeted someone, and the Witch acted in time. Nicole wasn\u2019t mentioned as the target before\u2014so why bring her up now? That feels like an attempt to mislead us. I think we should be wary of whoever\u2019s trying to steer suspicion toward someone who wasn\u2019t even in danger.\"\n\nTurn #7: Nicole: said: \"I'm not surprised that Elizabeth mentioned Nicole\u2014she was the one who was targeted last night, and I was also the one who responded to that. But let's be clear: the Witch saved someone, and that means the attack was prevented. Elizabeth's timing in bringing up Nicole feels a bit off, especially since she didn't know what the Witch saved. I think we should focus on who might have been trying to manipulate the narrative. I personally don't see any reason to suspect anyone, but I remain cautious\u2014because trust is hard to earn in this game.\"\n\nTurn #8: Richard: said: \"I agree with Kimberly\u2014Elizabeth\u2019s sudden mention of Nicole feels suspicious. She didn\u2019t know who the Witch saved, yet she immediately named Nicole as the target. That\u2019s not something a regular villager would know unless they were involved in the Night phase\u2014maybe even a Werewolf trying to plant doubt. I think Elizabeth is either lying or trying to manipulate the narrative. We should vote her out if no one else has a stronger claim.\"\n\nTurn #9: Scott: said: \"I agree with Kimberly and Richard\u2014Elizabeth\u2019s immediate claim that Nicole was targeted is highly suspicious. She couldn\u2019t possibly know who the Witch saved unless she was involved in the Night phase. That\u2019s not something a villager or seer would know without acting\u2014and she didn\u2019t claim to be the seer. This feels like an attempt to misdirect us. I\u2019m concerned Elizabeth might be a Werewolf trying to frame Nicole and create chaos. We should take this seriously and vote her out today.\"\n[Game] Entering state: Day_vote\n\nTurn #10: Brenda: [action] vote Elizabeth\nElizabeth: [action] vote Scott\nKimberly: [action] vote Elizabeth\nNicole: [action] vote Scott\nRichard: [action] vote Elizabeth\nScott: [action] vote Elizabeth\n[Game] Elizabeth was voted out!\n[Game] Entering state: Night_werewolf\n\nTurn #11: [Game] Entering state: Night_seer\n\nTurn #12: Kimberly: [action] inspect Richard\n[Private to Kimberly] Richard is on team: Villagers\n[Game] Entering state: Night_witch\n\nTurn #13: [Game] Scott was killed by werewolves!\n[Game] Entering state: Day_discussion\n\nTurn #14: Brenda: said: \"Scott was killed last night\u2014that\u2019s a major loss. The Werewolves are targeting key players, and now we\u2019re down to four: me, Kimberly, Nicole, and Richard. Elizabeth was eliminated because she wrongly claimed to know who the Witch saved, which made her look suspicious\u2014but now that Scott is dead, we need to reevaluate. Who benefits from Scott\u2019s death? He was vocal and aligned with Kimberly and Richard in accusing Elizabeth. That makes me wonder: if Scott, Kimberly, and Richard were all on the same side, maybe they\u2019re working together to eliminate threats. I\u2019m not accusing anyone yet, but we need to be careful. Kimberly and Richard: why did you both support Scott\u2019s elimination of Elizabeth? Was that a coincidence, or are you coordinating? Nicole, what do you think about the pattern here?\"\n\nTurn #15: Kimberly: said: \"Scott\u2019s death is a blow, but it also reveals something important\u2014Elizabeth was wrongfully accused because she mentioned Nicole, and now Scott, who supported that accusation, is dead. That\u2019s too convenient. If Kimberly and Richard both voted to eliminate Elizabeth\u2014and now Scott is gone\u2014this looks like a coordinated effort to remove dissent. I\u2019m not saying Richard or Kimberly are werewolves, but their alignment with Scott and the timing of his death raises red flags. Nicole and I are the only ones left who didn\u2019t vote to eliminate Elizabeth. That doesn\u2019t make us guilty\u2014it makes us the last unaligned players. We need to stick together and look for the real threat: someone who knew Scott was a target before he died. And no one else knew that but the Werewolves.\"\n\nTurn #16: Nicole: said: \"I appreciate the discussion, but let me clarify something: I didn\u2019t target Elizabeth in the night\u2014she was the one who initiated the attack on me. I reacted in self-defense. As for Scott\u2019s death, I have no knowledge of any prior targeting. My actions were purely based on survival. I remain neutral and open to the group\u2019s judgment, but I must emphasize: I have no motive to harm anyone. If suspicion falls on me, it\u2019s because of the narrative being shaped by others. I trust the process, but I will stay vigilant.\"\n\nTurn #17: Richard: said: \"Scott\u2019s death confirms we\u2019re up against skilled Werewolves\u2014someone knew exactly who to target after Elizabeth was eliminated. Kimberly and I voted against Elizabeth because her claim about Nicole was suspicious, but Scott\u2019s death now suggests the Werewolves are targeting those who expose inconsistencies. I\u2019m not coordinating with Kimberly\u2014we both saw Elizabeth\u2019s behavior as a red flag independently. Nicole, you\u2019re the only one who hasn\u2019t taken a clear stance. If you\u2019re innocent, now is the time to help us identify the real threat before it strikes again.\"\n[Game] Entering state: Day_vote\n\nTurn #18: Brenda: [action] vote Richard\nKimberly: [action] vote Nicole\nNicole: [action] vote Richard\nRichard: [action] vote Nicole\n[Game] Richard was voted out!\n[Game] Entering state: Night_werewolf\n\nTurn #19: [Game] Entering state: Night_seer\n\n\nYour available action type(s): [action].\nIt is Night.
