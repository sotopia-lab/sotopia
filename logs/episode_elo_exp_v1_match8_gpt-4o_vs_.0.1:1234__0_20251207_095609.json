WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public.

I'm open to everyone sharing their thoughts on who might be a werewolf.\"\n\nTurn #5: Matthew: said: \"It's really unfortunate that Jessica was targeted.

I noticed that Nicholas was inspected by Amy last night, and the result showed he is a werewolf. I'm not sure if this is a reliable piece of information since it's private, but it's worth considering.

I don't have any strong suspicions yet, but I'm open to hearing others' thoughts.\"\n\nTurn #7: Nicholas: said: \"I'm also saddened by Jessica's death. It feels like we're caught in a cycle of uncertainty. While I hear Amy's concern about the information she mentioned, I'm cautious as it seems like a deflection.

Nicholas, your caution is valid, but I think we should also remain open to information, especially if it comes from reliable sources like the Seer or Witch.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Cynthia, Matthew, Amy, Nicholas, Jessica, Nancy, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Nancy's) goal: Act openly and collaboratively to identify werewolves.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf.

I'm not sure who the werewolves are yet, but I think we should focus on discussing the possible suspects based on the information we have. Since Jessica is dead, we should look for any inconsistencies or suspicious behavior from the others. I'm open to everyone sharing their thoughts on who might be a werewolf.\"\n\nTurn #5: Matthew: said: \"It's really unfortunate that Jessica was targeted. Looking at the order and dynamics, it could be an attempt by the werewolves to disrupt or confuse us by eliminating someone outside the usual suspicion. Today, I don't have any strong leads, but I do think it's crucial we listen carefully to how everyone speaks and if anyone\u2019s statements don't match their past actions. Perhaps we can identify inconsistencies and narrow down our suspect list. Let's be careful.\"\n\nTurn #6: Amy: said: \"Jessica's death is unfortunate, but it doesn't immediately point to any specific werewolf. I noticed that Nicholas was inspected by Amy last night, and the result showed he is a werewolf.
