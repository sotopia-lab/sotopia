GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed.
