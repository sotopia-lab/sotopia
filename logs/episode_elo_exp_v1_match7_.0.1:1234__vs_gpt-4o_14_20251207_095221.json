WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone.

Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed.

WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed.

NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'.

Sandra makes a point about the timing and suspicions, but remember, there are multiple roles in play, and the witch might have saved someone they thought needed protection. I inspected Melissa last night, and I'd like to confirm she is a Villager, so let's consider our voting carefully.\"\"\n\nTurn #7: Joshua: said: \"Justin claims he inspected Melissa, but that\u2019s suspicious\u2014why would a villager reveal their inspection? He might be trying to manipulate us into trusting him. The witch saved someone, and now Justin\u2019s acting too confident. I think he\u2019s the werewolf trying to steer us away from Sandra. Let\u2019s vote him out.\"\n\nTurn #8: Melissa: said: \"I appreciate Justin confirming that I am a Villager, which aligns with my own awareness of the game. Everyone should note that no one died last night because I chose to protect Justin using my save potion, suspecting he might be targeted. I think it's too early to jump to conclusions solely based on suspicions. We need to gather more information and remain vigilant. Let's use this discussion phase to share insights without making rash decisions. Dorothy raised a good point earlier; perhaps someone has more to add about their observations or thoughts?\"\n\nTurn #9: Laura: said: \"It's interesting to see the thread of suspicion going from Dorothy to Sandra, and then Justin stepping in as a Seer to reveal Melissa's role. Given Melissa's confirmation and her move to protect Justin, there's some credibility added there. Joshua's point about Justin raising suspicions is valid, but it might also be a misdirection. We need to focus on solid evidence rather than assumptions. Could everyone recount their role in case we can piece together a clearer picture? Meanwhile, let's remember that we need solid reasoning behind our votes to avoid unnecessary losses.\"\n[Game] Entering state: Day_vote\n\nTurn #10: Dorothy: [action] vote Justin\nSandra: [action] vote Justin\nJustin: [action] vote Joshua\nJoshua: [action] vote Justin\nMelissa: [action] vote Joshua\nLaura: [action] vote Joshua\n[Game] Justin was voted out!\n[Game] Entering state: Night_werewolf\n\nTurn #11: [No recent activity]\n\nTurn #12: [Game] Entering state: Night_seer\n\nTurn #13: [Game] Entering state: Night_witch\n\nTurn #14: Melissa: [action] poison Joshua\n[Game] Laura was killed by werewolves!\n[Game] Joshua died by witch's poison!\n[Game] Entering state: Day_discussion\n\nTurn #15: Dorothy: said: \"It's a tense situation now with both Laura and Joshua gone. We need to proceed with caution in our suspicions and aim to minimize loss. Melissa's earlier move to save Justin, who was later revealed to be a Werewolf, complicates the trust dynamics. With Justin gone, I suggest we focus on observing Melissa and Sandra carefully, as the interplay between their actions last night might hold some hidden motives. Let's discuss our thoughts on whether these moves were protective or potentially misleading to unravel who the other Werewolf might be. Any other insights?\"\n\nTurn #16: Sandra: said: \"With Justin and Joshua gone, the remaining players are Dorothy, Melissa, and me. Laura was killed by werewolves\u2014so someone had to be the witch who poisoned Joshua. That means Melissa saved Justin, but Justin was a werewolf\u2014so her save was wasted. Why protect a werewolf? And now she\u2019s acting too calm, like she\u2019s hiding something. Dorothy, you\u2019re the only one left who hasn\u2019t been targeted... but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s luck or if you\u2019re the real threat. Let\u2019s be honest: Melissa\u2019s actions don\u2019t add up. I vote for her.\"\n\nTurn #17: Melissa: said: \"I understand there's confusion about my actions, and I'd like to clarify. Saving someone I believed might be targeted is a natural decision made in the interest of protecting villagers. The outcome wasn't what I intended, but I acted with the information I had. In the current situation, all three of us present have roles that could influence the game dramatically. I'd like to hear more concrete reasons for suspicion. Rather than focusing on creating doubt, we should pay attention to definitive patterns and consistent behavior. Who stands to gain most by my elimination?
