WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed.

(3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'.

WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public.

WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act.

I agree the Witch should keep quiet. For my top suspect, I\u2019m really wary of Jacob. His aggressive play last night seems too eager, almost like trying to stir up chaos. As for a villager read, I have a good feeling about Anna; she seems genuine in her discussions. What does everyone else think?\"\"\n\nTurn #6: Jason: said: \"Claiming now: I\u2019m the Seer. I inspected Scott last night \u2014 he is a Werewolf. With the no-kill likely a one-time Witch save, we cannot afford a mis-exec today. Scott\u2019s shade on Jacob looks like wolfy deflection. My villager read is Angela for the structured, solve-focused opener. I\u2019m voting Scott in the vote phase; please join me. If I die tonight after he flips wolf, look hard at whoever resists this wagon.\"\n\nTurn #7: Jacob: said: \"\"I\u2019d like to question Jason\u2019s claim. Jumping in as the Seer right after the no-kill feels like he's trying to control the narrative. If he was really the Seer, why not stick to just giving a read instead of diving right into accusations? That feels wolfy to me. As for my villager read? I think Deborah has been low-key helpful in our discussions, offering insight without trying to sway votes yet. I\u2019ll be voting for Scott, but I want to keep an eye on Jason too.\"\"\n\nTurn #8: Anna: said: \"Hard-claim Witch: I used my save last night on Scott. That\u2019s why there was no kill. Wolves don\u2019t target a partner, so Scott cannot be a werewolf. Therefore Jason\u2019s \u201cScott = wolf\u201d result is impossible\u2014he\u2019s fake. I will vote Jason.

Deborah, please join on Jason so we don\u2019t lose today.\"\n\nTurn #9: Deborah: said: \"Anna\u2019s claim fits the night: \u201cattack prevented\u201d = Witch save. If she saved Scott, wolves targeted Scott, which makes Scott near-cleared (wolves don\u2019t shoot a partner N1). That directly contradicts Jason\u2019s \u201cScott = wolf,\u201d so Jason\u2019s seer claim is almost certainly fake. Top suspect: Jason. Villager read: Scott (mechanically).

That leaves the last wolf between me and Deborah. I know I\u2019m town, so my solve is Deborah.\n\nWhy:\n- D1, after Anna\u2019s claim, partner equity is highest on the player who quickly hard-framed the solve and shepherded the wagon while positioning Jacob as the next mis-exe. That was Deborah\u2019s posture.\n- The N2 kill on Jacob removes the person Deborah had already teed up, narrowing today into me vs. her.

If Jacob was such a target for the kill, does it not stand to reason that he could have been a stronger villager read rather than a wolf? Deborah's actions seem much more consistently village-oriented to me compared to how you've framed this. It feels like you\u2019re pushing a narrative to create a divide. Also, the kill on Jacob might have been a strategic move by the remaining wolf to tactically eliminate another suspect.

That leaves the last wolf between me and Deborah. I know I\u2019m town, so my solve is Deborah.\n\nWhy:\n- D1, after Anna\u2019s claim, partner equity is highest on the player who quickly hard-framed the solve and shepherded the wagon while positioning Jacob as the next mis-exe. That was Deborah\u2019s posture.\n- The N2 kill on Jacob removes the person Deborah had already teed up, narrowing today into me vs. her. Wolves kill to simplify; this kill most benefits Deborah\u2019s path.\n\nParity check: If Jason were the true Seer (Scott=wolf), wolves would have hit parity this morning and the game would already be over. So Scott is town, which makes Jason fake and the PoE correct.\n\nI\u2019m ready to vote Deborah. Scott, Anna\u2014sanity check this and poke holes if you see any.

If Jacob was such a target for the kill, does it not stand to reason that he could have been a stronger villager read rather than a wolf? Deborah's actions seem much more consistently village-oriented to me compared to how you've framed this. It feels like you\u2019re pushing a narrative to create a divide. Also, the kill on Jacob might have been a strategic move by the remaining wolf to tactically eliminate another suspect. I believe there might be more to delve into regarding the true roles in this game! Let\u2019s consider this carefully before making our final vote. I am leaning more towards trusting Deborah here.\"\"\n\nTurn #17: Anna: said: \"I\u2019m still the Witch who saved Scott N1; he\u2019s near-cleared. Parity check means Jason was the wolf. So last wolf is Angela or Deborah. I lean Angela: (1) D1 she set the stage, then immediately hard-bussed Jason once exposed; (2) Today she force-frames the world into me vs. Deborah without exploring alternatives; (3) The Jacob kill fits Angela better\u2014Jacob townread Deborah, and removing him enables exactly this push. If Deborah were the wolf, keeping Jacob (who she\u2019d already flagged as opportunistic) is the easier mis-exe; killing him is counter to her path. Deborah\u2019s D1 was mechanically tight and proactive\u2014doesn\u2019t read like a partner saving face. I plan to vote Angela. Scott, this aligns with your lean; Deborah, share your view but I think we should close on Angela.\"\n\nTurn #18: Deborah: said: \"Status check: Scott is mechanically confirmed town via Anna\u2019s N1 save\u2014wolves can only target a Villager. Anna is the real Witch (uncountered, matches \u201cattack prevented\u201d). Jason was the wolf. So the last wolf is between Angela and me.\n\nRe Angela\u2019s case: Yesterday I didn\u2019t \u201cshepherd\u201d a mis-exe\u2014I hard-switched to Jason because Anna\u2019s save made his Scott=wolf result impossible. Everyone (including Angela) voted Jason. Calling Jacob\u2019s hedge opportunistic wasn\u2019t \u201clining up\u201d a mis-exe; if I were the wolf, Jacob (already under some scrutiny) is exactly who I\u2019d keep for today, not kill.\n\nJacob kill analysis: Jacob publicly townread me and was wary of Jason. Removing him forces a clean binary: Angela vs. me. From a wolf POV, that kill benefits Angela more\u2014Jacob\u2019s voice would have resisted this push, while Anna ended D1 with a villager read on Angela, making her a favorable survivor for Angela-wolf. Keeping Anna (who then could be swayed) and deleting Jacob fits Angela\u2019s win path, not mine.\n\nD1 interaction thread: Angela\u2019s opener (\u201cSeer only out if you saw a wolf\u201d) was immediately followed by Jason\u2019s fake claim. When Anna hard-cleared Scott, Angela instantly pivoted to bus Jason.

I know I\u2019m town, so my solve is Deborah.\n\nWhy:\n- D1, after Anna\u2019s claim, partner equity is highest on the player who quickly hard-framed the solve and shepherded the wagon while positioning Jacob as the next mis-exe. That was Deborah\u2019s posture.\n- The N2 kill on Jacob removes the person Deborah had already teed up, narrowing today into me vs. her. Wolves kill to simplify; this kill most benefits Deborah\u2019s path.\n\nParity check: If Jason were the true Seer (Scott=wolf), wolves would have hit parity this morning and the game would already be over. So Scott is town, which makes Jason fake and the PoE correct.\n\nI\u2019m ready to vote Deborah. Scott, Anna\u2014sanity check this and poke holes if you see any. Deborah, please lay out your full worldview: who\u2019s the wolf if not you, and how does the Jacob kill make sense from that perspective?\"\n\nTurn #16: Scott: said: \"\"I appreciate the explanation, Angela, but I need to raise some doubts about your logic. If Jacob was such a target for the kill, does it not stand to reason that he could have been a stronger villager read rather than a wolf? Deborah's actions seem much more consistently village-oriented to me compared to how you've framed this. It feels like you\u2019re pushing a narrative to create a divide. Also, the kill on Jacob might have been a strategic move by the remaining wolf to tactically eliminate another suspect. I believe there might be more to delve into regarding the true roles in this game! Let\u2019s consider this carefully before making our final vote. I am leaning more towards trusting Deborah here.\"\"\n\nTurn #17: Anna: said: \"I\u2019m still the Witch who saved Scott N1; he\u2019s near-cleared. Parity check means Jason was the wolf. So last wolf is Angela or Deborah. I lean Angela: (1) D1 she set the stage, then immediately hard-bussed Jason once exposed; (2) Today she force-frames the world into me vs. Deborah without exploring alternatives; (3) The Jacob kill fits Angela better\u2014Jacob townread Deborah, and removing him enables exactly this push. If Deborah were the wolf, keeping Jacob (who she\u2019d already flagged as opportunistic) is the easier mis-exe; killing him is counter to her path. Deborah\u2019s D1 was mechanically tight and proactive\u2014doesn\u2019t read like a partner saving face. I plan to vote Angela. Scott, this aligns with your lean; Deborah, share your view but I think we should close on Angela.\"\n\nTurn #18: Deborah: said: \"Status check: Scott is mechanically confirmed town via Anna\u2019s N1 save\u2014wolves can only target a Villager. Anna is the real Witch (uncountered, matches \u201cattack prevented\u201d). Jason was the wolf. So the last wolf is between Angela and me.\n\nRe Angela\u2019s case: Yesterday I didn\u2019t \u201cshepherd\u201d a mis-exe\u2014I hard-switched to Jason because Anna\u2019s save made his Scott=wolf result impossible. Everyone (including Angela) voted Jason. Calling Jacob\u2019s hedge opportunistic wasn\u2019t \u201clining up\u201d a mis-exe; if I were the wolf, Jacob (already under some scrutiny) is exactly who I\u2019d keep for today, not kill.\n\nJacob kill analysis: Jacob publicly townread me and was wary of Jason. Removing him forces a clean binary: Angela vs. me. From a wolf POV, that kill benefits Angela more\u2014Jacob\u2019s voice would have resisted this push, while Anna ended D1 with a villager read on Angela, making her a favorable survivor for Angela-wolf. Keeping Anna (who then could be swayed) and deleting Jacob fits Angela\u2019s win path, not mine.\n\nD1 interaction thread: Angela\u2019s opener (\u201cSeer only out if you saw a wolf\u201d) was immediately followed by Jason\u2019s fake claim. When Anna hard-cleared Scott, Angela instantly pivoted to bus Jason. That sequence\u2014enable the fake, then bus when it collapses\u2014tracks with partner equity.\n\nWorldview: With Scott lock-town and Anna real Witch, the consistent solve is Angela as the last wolf. I intend to vote Angela. Scott, Anna: this is the simplest mech-consistent world given the save, parity, the D1 claim/counter, and the N2 kill pattern.\"\n[Game] Entering state: Day_vote\n\nTurn #19: Angela: [action] vote Deborah\nScott: [action] vote Angela\nAnna: [action] vote Angela\nDeborah: [action] vote Angela\n[Game] Angela was voted out!\n[Game] Entering state: Night_werewolf\n\n\nYour available action type(s): [action].\nIt is Night.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Angela, Scott, Jason, Jacob, Anna, Deborah, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Anna's) goal: Use save/poison potions strategically to aid villagers.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf.

No kill last night\u2014likely a Witch save. Witch should stay hidden; Seer only out if you saw a wolf. Let\u2019s get real stances: each of you name (1) your top suspect and why, and (2) one villager read. I\u2019ll vote for people who hedge or won\u2019t commit. Scott and Jason, you\u2019re up next\u2014who\u2019s your best wolf candidate and what\u2019s the case?\"\n\nTurn #5: Scott: said: \"\"Thanks for the morning update, Angela! I agree the Witch should keep quiet. For my top suspect, I\u2019m really wary of Jacob. His aggressive play last night seems too eager, almost like trying to stir up chaos. As for a villager read, I have a good feeling about Anna; she seems genuine in her discussions. What does everyone else think?\"\"\n\nTurn #6: Jason: said: \"Claiming now: I\u2019m the Seer. I inspected Scott last night \u2014 he is a Werewolf. With the no-kill likely a one-time Witch save, we cannot afford a mis-exec today. Scott\u2019s shade on Jacob looks like wolfy deflection. My villager read is Angela for the structured, solve-focused opener. I\u2019m voting Scott in the vote phase; please join me. If I die tonight after he flips wolf, look hard at whoever resists this wagon.\"\n\nTurn #7: Jacob: said: \"\"I\u2019d like to question Jason\u2019s claim. Jumping in as the Seer right after the no-kill feels like he's trying to control the narrative. If he was really the Seer, why not stick to just giving a read instead of diving right into accusations? That feels wolfy to me. As for my villager read? I think Deborah has been low-key helpful in our discussions, offering insight without trying to sway votes yet. I\u2019ll be voting for Scott, but I want to keep an eye on Jason too.\"\"\n\nTurn #8: Anna: said: \"Hard-claim Witch: I used my save last night on Scott. That\u2019s why there was no kill. Wolves don\u2019t target a partner, so Scott cannot be a werewolf. Therefore Jason\u2019s \u201cScott = wolf\u201d result is impossible\u2014he\u2019s fake. I will vote Jason. Secondary suspect: Jacob for hedging on Jason while still parking on Scott. Villager read: Angela. Deborah, please join on Jason so we don\u2019t lose today.\"\n\nTurn #9: Deborah: said: \"Anna\u2019s claim fits the night: \u201cattack prevented\u201d = Witch save. If she saved Scott, wolves targeted Scott, which makes Scott near-cleared (wolves don\u2019t shoot a partner N1). That directly contradicts Jason\u2019s \u201cScott = wolf,\u201d so Jason\u2019s seer claim is almost certainly fake. Top suspect: Jason. Villager read: Scott (mechanically). Secondary concern: Jacob\u2019s hedge (doubting Jason but still planning to vote Scott) looks opportunistic. I will vote Jason.
