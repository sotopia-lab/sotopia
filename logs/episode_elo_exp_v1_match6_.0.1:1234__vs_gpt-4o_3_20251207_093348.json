WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed.

Let\u2019s focus on finding out who the werewolves might be among us. I think it might be wise to share any observations or unusual behavior we've noticed since the last discussion. Does anyone have any suspicions or insights they would like to share?\"\n\nTurn #16: Donna: said: \"\"Good morning, everyone. It\u2019s reassuring that we had a night without any casualties. Let's not lose sight of our goal. I spent the night contemplating recent discussions and feel more inclined to trust Jessica now, her approach and insights have been consistently constructive. This doesn\u2019t rule out other possibilities, but I think it\u2019s crucial we narrow down our focus. Shirley and Brenda, your thoughts?\u201d\"\n\nTurn #17: Jessica: said: \"\"It's encouraging to see that our strategy is helping us progress with no losses last night. The fact that Brian's removal aligned with multiple suspicions is reassuring, but we must remain vigilant. Donna's support is appreciated, and I believe that continued open dialogue, just like it's been, is crucial. We should be observant of any behavioral shifts today because they might indicate attempts by the remaining werewolves to stay hidden. Brenda, Shirley, William, I encourage you to voice any new thoughts or instinctive reactions you've observed since Brian's vote out. It\u2019s collective discernment that will guide us to victory.\"\"\n\nTurn #18: Brenda: said: \"It\u2019s reassuring that no one was harmed last night, which tells me we're on the right track. Donna, I agree with your assessment of Jessica\u2014it\u2019s crucial for us to trust those showing consistent and constructive insight. I think we should remain observant of potential behavioral changes in other players. While Brian\u2019s vote out resonated with many of us, we need to focus on uncovering who might have been strategically keeping a low profile. William, Shirley, and Jessica, I'm curious if any of you noticed subtle changes in interactions or exchanges that didn\u2019t sit right. Our collective effort will be key to identifying the remaining threat.\"\n[Game] Entering state: Day_vote\n\n\nYour available action type(s): [action].\nIt is voting time.
