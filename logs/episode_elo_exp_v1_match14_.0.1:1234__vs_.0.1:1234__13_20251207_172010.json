WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager.

NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager.

WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'.

WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Steven, Andrew, Dorothy, Barbara, Karen, Kimberly, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Karen's) goal: Use save/poison potions strategically to aid villagers.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf.

I'm glad the attack was prevented\u2014someone must have used the save potion! Since we're all still alive, let's work together to figure out who might be a werewolf. I don't have any info yet, but I'm open to hearing everyone's thoughts. Andrew, Dorothy, Barbara\u2014what did you notice during the night? We need to be careful and logical.\"\n\nTurn #5: Andrew: said: \"I didn't notice anything unusual during the night. I was just following the usual pattern, and I'm not sure what happened to Dorothy\u2014maybe she was targeted by someone else. I trust the group's ability to figure this out through discussion.\"\n\nTurn #6: Dorothy: said: \"Thanks, Steven. I didn\u2019t notice anything unusual either, but I\u2019m glad the attack was prevented\u2014someone must have used the save potion. Since Andrew says he didn\u2019t notice anything, and I\u2019m still alive, maybe the werewolves are trying to target someone who seems suspicious. Let\u2019s keep an eye on who\u2019s deflecting or being too quiet. Barbara, what do you think?\"\n\nTurn #7: Barbara: said: \"I agree with Dorothy that someone must have used the save potion to prevent an attack. I didn\u2019t notice anything unusual either, and I\u2019m still alive, so I don\u2019t think I was targeted. I\u2019m keeping an open mind about everyone\u2014maybe the werewolves are hiding in plain sight. Let\u2019s focus on who seems too defensive or inconsistent, like Andrew, who didn\u2019t mention anything about Dorothy. I\u2019m not saying he\u2019s a wolf, but I\u2019d like to see more evidence before making a guess.\"\n\nTurn #8: Karen: said: \"I\u2019m glad Dorothy is safe\u2014thank you to whoever used the save potion. Barbara, I think your suspicion toward Andrew might be misplaced; he didn\u2019t say much because there was nothing to observe during the night. I\u2019m more curious about who had the opportunity and motive to target Dorothy\u2014was she seen as a threat? I\u2019m not pointing fingers yet, but I\u2019ll be watching who tries to steer the blame. Kimberly, what\u2019s your take?\"\n\nTurn #9: Kimberly: said: \"Thanks, Karen. I\u2019m also glad Dorothy is safe\u2014someone clearly used the save potion wisely. I agree with Barbara that we should watch for defensiveness or inconsistency, but I don\u2019t think Andrew\u2019s silence is suspicious\u2014he genuinely couldn\u2019t have known anything during the night.
