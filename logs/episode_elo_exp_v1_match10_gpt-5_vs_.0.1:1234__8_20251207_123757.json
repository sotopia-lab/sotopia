WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone.

NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Dorothy, Emma, Deborah, Stephen, Lisa, Sharon, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Dorothy's) goal: Act openly and collaboratively to identify werewolves.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf.

NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager.

The Werewolves targeted Sharon, which means they\u2019re trying to eliminate strong voices who saw through Emma\u2019s misdirection. Deborah\u2019s poison suggests the Witch is still alive and acted to take out someone she believed was a wolf\u2014probably Emma, since we all voted her out. That means the Witch is likely on our side! Stephen and I are still here, and Lisa too. We need to stick together: the Werewolves are now only two left (since Emma\u2019s out), and we have three villagers/seer/witch alive. Let\u2019s not let fear or confusion split us now. Stephen, Lisa\u2014I trust your reads. Who do we think the remaining werewolves are? I\u2019m not pointing fingers yet, but we must act smart.\"\n\nTurn #15: Stephen: said: \"Sharon kill + Deborah poison tells us: N1 save and N2 poison are spent; Witch is alive but out of shots, and only one wolf remains. The night kill hit the clearest, confident voice (Sharon) to reduce pushback today. \n\nWhy I think it\u2019s Dorothy over Lisa:\n- Logical slips that read like narrative shaping: Dorothy said \u201cwerewolves are now only two left (since Emma\u2019s out)\u201d\u2014that\u2019s just wrong; there were two to start, one remains. She also framed Deborah\u2019s poison as somehow about Emma, when poison killed Deborah. That\u2019s not careful town thinking.\n- Pocketing posture: \u201cStephen and Lisa\u2014I trust your reads\u201d while offering no suspect and asking us to lead. Wolves love to let others pick a name and then follow the safer wagon.\n- Day 1 bus dynamic: Dorothy was first onto Emma when voting opened and rode the momentum for easy cred after Emma drew heat. That fits partner-bus-play.\n\nLisa\u2019s D1 was coherent: called out circular logic, gave reasons on Emma, then voted once everyone had spoken. That arc looks town.\n\nI\u2019m planning to vote Dorothy here. Lisa, if you see it differently, tell me why\u2014but the cleanest team is Emma + Dorothy.\"\n\nTurn #16: Lisa: said: \"Stephen, you\u2019re right about the math\u2014there was one werewolf left after Emma\u2019s elimination, and Sharon\u2019s death confirms they targeted a strong town voice. But your conclusion that Dorothy is the wolf doesn\u2019t hold up. She didn\u2019t miscount\u2014she was clarifying the *current* state: two werewolves started, one died (Emma), so one remains. That\u2019s correct. Her trust in us isn\u2019t pocketing\u2014it\u2019s strategic alignment with clear thinkers. And if she were a wolf, why would she publicly acknowledge the Witch\u2019s role in killing Deborah? That only strengthens our position. I\u2019m not convinced she\u2019s guilty. The real threat is the werewolf who killed Sharon to silence dissent\u2014and that\u2019s still out there. I\u2019m not voting until we have a concrete reason.
