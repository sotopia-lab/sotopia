WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone.

Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed.

WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act.

WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act.

DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Jessica, Joseph, Eric, James, Karen, Emily, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Karen's) goal: Use save/poison potions strategically to aid villagers.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf. The game begins!\n\nTurn #1: [Game] Entering state: Night_seer\n\nTurn #2: [Game] Entering state: Night_witch\n\nTurn #3: Karen: [action] save Jessica\n[Game] An attack was prevented!\n[Game] Entering state: Day_discussion\n\nTurn #4: Jessica: said: \"Good morning everyone! I'm Jessica, and I'm here to help us work together to identify the werewolves. Since we just had a night where an attack was prevented, I think it's important that we stay calm and focus on discussing who might be a suspect. I don't have any specific information yet, but I believe open and honest conversation is key. Let's keep an eye out for any inconsistencies or suspicious behavior from anyone. I'm open to hearing everyone's thoughts!\"\n\nTurn #5: Joseph: said: \"Wild start with no death\u2014likely a Witch save, so let\u2019s avoid pushing for role claims. Seer should stay quiet for now. Can we each give one lean and a name we\u2019d actually vote today? Hedging with \u201cno reads\u201d is the easiest wolf cover. Jessica\u2019s opener was very safe; I\u2019m neutral there but want more specifics. Eric and Karen, who\u2019s your top suspect and why? James, can you help consolidate a shortlist after everyone speaks?\"\n\nTurn #6: Eric: said: \"I'm Eric, and I'm not going to make any bold claims just yet. I appreciate Joseph's cautious approach\u2014staying neutral is wise. Since the night had no death, it's likely the witch used her save, which makes me think the wolves are trying to hide their numbers. I'll keep an eye on James, as I inspected him last night and found him to be a werewolf. That's my only personal insight, but I'm open to hearing others' observations. I trust the group to find the truth through discussion.\"\n\nTurn #7: James: said: \"Eric\u2019s post is wildly inconsistent: he opens with \u201cnot going to make bold claims,\u201d then immediately hard-claims a red on me and even hedges with \u201ckeep an eye on James.\u201d A real Seer who actually hit a wolf wouldn\u2019t waffle there. Also, with a prevented kill, it\u2019s very likely the Witch already used the save. A real Seer outing Day 1 is just volunteering to die tonight\u2014exactly the kind of 1-for-1 trade a wolf fake-claim would love to force. I am not a werewolf. I think Eric is fake and I\u2019m prepared to vote him today. If he flips Seer (which I doubt), you can come for me tomorrow. Karen, Emily: do you really buy that timing and wording from Eric? Jessica, does that read feel genuine to you? I\u2019d much rather eliminate the claimant than give scum a free miselim on a single uncorroborated claim.\"\n\nTurn #8: Karen: said: \"James, your critique of Eric is sharp and highlights a real inconsistency\u2014many players would hesitate to make a direct accusation without evidence, especially on Day 1. I agree that Eric's claim of inspecting James and finding him a werewolf is suspicious, especially given his earlier statement of not making bold claims. However, I also see that he didn't provide any actual proof\u2014just a single assertion. I\u2019m not convinced he\u2019s a werewolf, but I\u2019m also not ready to fully dismiss his claim. That said, I think we should be cautious about voting on someone with only one piece of information. I believe the witch likely saved someone, so the real threat might be in the wolves who are hiding their identity. I\u2019m open to voting for Eric if the group feels strongly, but I\u2019d prefer to see more consistent patterns from others before making a decision. I stand by the idea of staying calm and looking for patterns in behavior, not just one-off claims.\"\n\nTurn #9: Emily: said: \"James, your point about Eric's inconsistency is very valid and aligns with how I would assess a real Seer's behavior. A genuine Seer would not make such a sudden and contradictory claim\u2014first saying they won't make bold claims, then immediately accusing someone of being a werewolf with no supporting evidence. That kind of shift is a red flag. I also agree that the lack of death strongly suggests the witch used her save, so we should be careful not to rush into voting based on isolated claims. I trust that the group will work together to find the truth through consistent, calm discussion. I don\u2019t have any personal insights, but I\u2019m fully supportive of questioning claims that lack balance or evidence. I\u2019d prefer to see more players share their observations before making a decision. Let\u2019s keep the focus on behavior and patterns, not just one person\u2019s statement.\"\n[Game] Entering state: Day_vote\n\nTurn #10: Jessica: [action] vote Eric\nJoseph: [action] vote Eric\nEric: [action] vote James\nJames: [action] vote Eric\nKaren: [action] vote Eric\nEmily: [action] vote Eric\n[Game] Eric was voted out!\n[Game] Entering state: Night_werewolf\n\nTurn #11: [No recent activity]\n\nTurn #12: [Game] Entering state: Night_seer\n\nTurn #13: [Game] Entering state: Night_witch\n\n\nYour available action type(s): [action].\nIt is Night.
