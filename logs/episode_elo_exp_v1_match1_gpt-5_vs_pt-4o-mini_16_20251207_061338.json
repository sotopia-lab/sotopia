GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Ryan, Pamela, George, Sandra, Stephanie, Melissa, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Sandra's) goal: Deceive others, avoid detection, and eliminate villagers.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf.

We need to consider who might have the motive to eliminate her. I propose we discuss our suspicions and try to ascertain which among us could be the Werewolves. Let's share any information or gut feelings we might have.\"\n\nTurn #5: Pamela: said: \"Stephanie was a voice who pushes back, so killing her feels like wolves wanting a quieter day. Ryan's opener is very safe - not alignment-indicative - but we need concrete stances. My early lean is Melissa: she benefits most from Stephanie not being here and often avoids leading. George, where would you vote right now? Sandra, who pings you? Seer, please don't claim unless you've hit a wolf. If Melissa doesn't give a solid take this round, I'm likely to vote there.\"\n\nTurn #6: George: said: \"\"I agree with Pamela that we need concrete stances. While I'm still processing everything, I do feel that blaming Melissa might be jumping the gun without more evidence. Let's gather more information from each player before rushing to a vote. I want to hear more from everyone, especially Melissa and Sandra, about their thoughts on last night\u2019s events.\"\"\n\nTurn #7: Sandra: said: \"Stephanie dying N1 looks like wolves removing pushback. That doesn\u2019t auto-clear or condemn anyone, but the slot that benefits most from a quieter day is Melissa. If Melissa can\u2019t give a firm solve with reasons, I\u2019m comfortable voting there.\n\nRyan, your opener is all process and no suspects\u2014who are your top 1\u20132 right now? George, you pushed back on a Melissa vote; if you had to vote this second, where does it go and why?\n\nEarly leans: Melissa > Ryan > George. Pamela feels proactively solving; slight townlean. Melissa, please give two suspects with reasons and who you\u2019d vote now. If your answer is just \u201cneed more info,\u201d that\u2019s not enough today.\"\n\nTurn #8: Melissa: said: \"\"I understand the concerns being raised about me, and I appreciate the push for clarity. It's important to analyze the situation carefully. My thinking is this: while Stephanie's removal does seem to benefit me, I believe we must consider other motives as well. I suspect Ryan could be trying to blend in with his approach, which can often be a werewolf strategy. Additionally, I feel George is being a bit too cautious, which could also be a sign of a werewolf trying to avoid scrutiny. That said, my immediate suspects are Ryan and George based on their responses. I'd vote for Ryan right now because I feel there's less urgency in his statements, which can be indicative of a wolf.
