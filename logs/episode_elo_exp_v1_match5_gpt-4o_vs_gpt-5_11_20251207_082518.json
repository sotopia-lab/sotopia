GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'.

WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed.

NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Linda, Shirley, Brandon, Kimberly, Kathleen, Melissa, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Kathleen's) goal: Use save/poison potions strategically to aid villagers.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf. The game begins!\n\nTurn #1: [Game] Entering state: Night_seer\n\nTurn #2: [Game] Entering state: Night_witch\n\nTurn #3: Kathleen: [action] save Linda\n[Game] An attack was prevented!\n[Game] Entering state: Day_discussion\n\nTurn #4: Linda: said: \"Good morning! No one died last night\u2014likely a Witch save\u2014nice. Seer: only reveal today if you have a wolf result; otherwise stay hidden. Witch: please stay hidden too and keep poison unless you\u2019re very sure. To make this day useful, let\u2019s each share (1) one suspect and a specific reason, (2) one town-lean and why, and (3) who you\u2019d vote right now. For me: with no info yet, I want to pressure whoever is most evasive or hedgy; I won\u2019t lock a vote until we hear from everyone. Shirley, you\u2019re up\u2014who\u2019s your top suspect and your current vote?\"\n\nTurn #5: Shirley: said: \"Hi everyone! So, my immediate thoughts are, last night's witch save could point towards someone feeling under pressure, but I'm cautious not to jump to conclusions. I'm keeping an eye on Brandon. I noticed he was a little quiet during our earlier discussions, which could indicate he's trying to lay low. As for my town lean, I'm getting village vibes from Kimberly; she seemed ready to jump into action. So if I had to vote right now, I'd pick Brandon. Let's hear everyone else before we decide.\"\n\nTurn #6: Brandon: said: \"Morning. Agree: no claims unless a red. On Shirley\u2014calling me \u2018quiet\u2019 when I\u2019m 3rd to speak feels like low-effort shade, and the quick townread on Kimberly without specifics looks like potential buddying. My suspect right now is Shirley. My town-lean is Linda for pushing a structured, pro-town plan and measured approach. If I had to vote now, I\u2019d vote Shirley, but I\u2019ll re-evaluate after we hear from the rest.\n\nQuestions: Kimberly, who\u2019s your top suspect and why? Kathleen, between me and Shirley, who\u2019s likelier wolf and what specific post tipped it? Melissa, who\u2019s your top scumread and where would your vote go right now?\"\n\nTurn #7: Kimberly: said: \"Hey everyone! Morning! Thanks for the town lean, Shirley, though I admit flattery can sometimes be misleading, but I\u2019ll take it! I'm trying to consider all angles without jumping the gun. Brandon and Shirley\u2019s interaction caught my eye\u2014Brandon defending himself right after being mentioned makes sense from a villager perspective, but the buddying call-out makes me wary of dismissing anything too fast. \n\nRight now, my lean for potentially being a wolf is a bit on Shirley. I feel there was a quick trust thrown my way, which feels like it could be an attempt to win over allies early. For town lean, possibly Linda, for pushing for a reasoned discussion. \n\nFor voting, I'd tentatively go towards Shirley but am open to changing my mind based on what others share. \n\nLooking forward to hearing from Kathleen and Melissa next!\"\n\nTurn #8: Kathleen: said: \"Between Brandon and Shirley, Shirley is likelier wolf. Her first post throws low-effort shade at Brandon for being \u201cquiet\u201d when he was only 3rd to speak, and she gave Kimberly a quick townread without specifics\u2014reads like buddying. The \u201cwitch save could point to someone feeling under pressure\u201d bit also doesn\u2019t track with N1 dynamics.\n\nMy suspect: Shirley, for the above.\nTown-lean: Linda for driving a clear, accountable plan and disciplined claims.\nIf I had to vote now: Shirley.\n\nMelissa, where are you on Shirley vs Brandon, and do you have a separate scumread? If not Shirley, who\u2019s your alternative and why?\"\n\nTurn #9: Melissa: said: \"Leaning Shirley > Brandon. Reasons: (1) calling Brandon \u201cquiet\u201d when he was 3rd to speak feels manufactured, (2) instant townread on Kimberly without specifics reads like pocketing, and (3) the N1 \u201cwitch save = someone under pressure\u201d take doesn\u2019t track with N1 dynamics. \nTown leans: Linda for the structured plan; slight town on Brandon for the pushback plus pointed questions that create accountability. Kimberly is null-to-slight-town\u2014cautious tone is good, but I\u2019m wary of the early townread from Shirley.\nIf Shirley flips wolf, I\u2019d recheck Kimberly as potential pocket target and look for who subtly protected Shirley. If Shirley flips villager, I\u2019ll re-examine Brandon for opportunism and also anyone who just sheeped without adding new thought.\nRight now, I\u2019d vote Shirley.\"\n[Game] Entering state: Day_vote\n\nTurn #10: Linda: [action] vote Shirley\nShirley: [action] vote Brandon\nBrandon: [action] vote Shirley\nKimberly: [action] vote Shirley\nKathleen: [action] vote Shirley\nMelissa: [action] vote Shirley\n[Game] Shirley was voted out!\n[Game] Entering state: Night_werewolf\n\nTurn #11: [Game] Entering state: Night_seer\n\nTurn #12: [Game] Entering state: Night_witch\n\n\nYour available action type(s): [action].\nIt is Night.
