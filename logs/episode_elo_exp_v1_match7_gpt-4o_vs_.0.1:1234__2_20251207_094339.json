WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'.

NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Emma, Sharon, Jonathan, Brenda, Betty, Linda, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Jonathan's) goal: Discreetly inspect players at night to uncover werewolves.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf.

I'm concerned because she was a quiet player and didn't seem to be a threat\u2014this feels like an early, targeted kill. Let\u2019s pay close attention to who is acting suspiciously during discussion. I think we should all share our roles honestly if possible, and work together to find the wolves before they strike again.\"\n\nTurn #5: Sharon: said: \"I can't believe Betty's gone so early! I agree with Emma that the werewolves must see her as a big threat. Maybe they thought she was one of the powerful roles like the Seer or the Witch and wanted to take her out quickly. We need to be strategic about this. Does anyone have any insights or gut feelings on who could be acting a bit dodgy? It\u2019s crucial we cooperate and ensure the wolves don\u2019t get the better of us. Let's discuss who has been acting unusually and cast our votes wisely.\"\n\nTurn #6: Jonathan: said: \"Betty's death is concerning, and I agree with Emma and Sharon that this was a targeted kill. Since she wasn't vocal, the werewolves might have suspected her role\u2014or they\u2019re just trying to eliminate anyone who could be a threat. I\u2019m not sure yet who to trust, but I\u2019ll be listening closely to everyone\u2019s statements. Let\u2019s watch for inconsistencies in the coming votes.\"\n\nTurn #7: Brenda: said: \"I\u2019m shocked to hear about Betty's untimely demise. It seemed like she was keeping a low profile, and perhaps the wolves saw her silence as a sign of potential danger to them. I'm hesitant to speculate too much without hard evidence, but maybe we need to look at who isn't participating as actively. Sometimes staying under the radar is a tactic to avoid detection. Let\u2019s be cautious but thorough in our discussions.\"\n\nTurn #8: Linda: said: \"Betty's death is a blow, and I agree it was likely targeted\u2014werewolves often strike early to remove potential threats. Since she was quiet, maybe they thought she was the Seer or Witch. I\u2019m not accusing anyone yet, but I think we should pay attention to who tries to steer the conversation too hard or avoids answering direct questions.
