GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act.

WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public.

WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public.

We lost Elizabeth to the werewolves, and Brenda was poisoned by the witch. We need to regroup and rethink our strategy. My suspicions remain on Anthony, but now we have a bigger problem. Let's discuss what we know and look for clues that might indicate who the werewolves are among us. It's crucial that we all share our thoughts to avoid another casualty. What are everyone's thoughts on who could be the werewolves?\"\"\n\nTurn #16: Stephanie: said: \"This is likely lylo (one misvote loses), so no fluff: commit and justify. My solve right now is Betty = wolf, Mary = town.\n\nWhy Betty:\n- D1 she set up the easy \u201coverly defensive\u201d frame, then never named a concrete wolf/town before the vote, and slid onto the Anthony wagon with the crowd. That\u2019s safe positioning.\n- Today she opens with generic \u201cwe have a bigger problem\u201d and \u201cmy suspicions remain on Anthony\u201d (who\u2019s dead, with no flips). That\u2019s contentless and keeps her non-committal at the exact moment we need precision.\n- The witch\u2019s poison on Brenda isn\u2019t a flip; witches can be wrong. Using it as a hard clear/condemn is WIFOM. We should judge day play. Betty\u2019s day play reads like agenda-control without ownership.\n\nMary: you gave a scumlean + what would change your mind D1, which is a villagery process. Your echo on Anthony was cautious, but you explained conditions to reconsider. I townlean that.\n\nBetty, no more generalities. Answer these now:\n1) Who is the wolf between me and Mary, and give a concise case.\n2) Who is most town and why (one sentence).\n3) If Anthony was town, explain your D1 vote on him in terms of process; if you think he was wolf, explain why wolves night-killed Elizabeth instead of protecting a partner under pressure.\n\nUnless I get a sharp, testable case from Betty that makes sense with both the D1 vote dynamics and last night\u2019s kills, I\u2019m planning to vote Betty.\"\n\nTurn #17: Mary: said: \"\"I agree with Stephanie's analysis of Betty's behavior. It feels like she's trying to deflect attention rather than provide clear insights. The last night's kills indicate a need for closer scrutiny on our remaining players. I see strong reasoning to suspect Betty as potentially being a werewolf. Based on her actions, if we don't act decisively today, we risk losing another key player. I would support a vote for Betty unless she presents a robust defense.
