WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Nancy, David, Edward, Daniel, Charles, Eric, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (David's) goal: Deceive others, avoid detection, and eliminate villagers.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf.

This is interesting because it means either the Werewolves targeted someone who was saved, or the attack was thwarted in some other way. We should discuss who we suspect might be among the Werewolves based on what we know. Let's gather our thoughts!\"\n\nTurn #5: David: said: \"Glad nobody died. Most likely a Witch save, which means we can\u2019t afford a sloppy vote today. Seer should only speak up if you\u2019ve got a wolf; otherwise stay hidden. Let\u2019s each give one suspect with a concrete reason. For me, I\u2019m watching the late speakers\u2014Charles and Eric\u2014since it\u2019s easy to hedge after hearing everyone. If either of you jumps on a safe consensus without substance, that pings me. Nancy\u2019s opener is fine but very neutral. Edward, who are your top two suspects right now? I\u2019ll lean my vote toward whoever dodges specifics.\"\n\nTurn #6: Edward: said: \"I appreciate the ideas shared so far. I agree with David that we need to be cautious with our votes today. As for my suspects, I'm looking closely at Daniel and Eric. Daniel has been somewhat quiet and evasive in his responses, which makes me wonder about his motives. Eric, although he has spoken, seems to be avoiding any strong accusations. Those are my thoughts for now.\"\n\nTurn #7: Daniel: said: \"Glad we got a save. I\u2019m with David on wanting specifics and commitment. Edward calling me \u201cevasive\u201d before I\u2019ve even spoken is weird and feels like pre-emptive shade; that pings me. Nancy\u2019s opener is neutral; David\u2019s framework is solid.\n\nI\u2019m watching the late speakers. Charles and Eric: please each give two suspects and a preferred vote with reasons. If either of you hedges or piggybacks a safe consensus, I\u2019m happy to vote there. If you both give substantive takes, I\u2019ll lean my vote to Edward for the weak, agenda-y push on me.\"\n\nTurn #8: Charles: said: \"I appreciate the discussion so far. I agree with the concerns about late speakers potentially hedging their bets. However, I want to address Daniel\u2019s points. While I understand the desire for specifics, I believe it\u2019s important to also consider behavior patterns from earlier phases. I'm currently leaning towards suspecting Eric and Daniel as well. Eric has been somewhat vague in his assertions, and Daniel\u2019s defensive posture about criticism strikes me as suspicious. I prefer to vote for one of them unless more compelling evidence surfaces.\"\n\nTurn #9: Eric: said: \"I appreciate the sentiments shared so far, especially around the need for specifics. I want to clarify my position: I think there's a risk in pointing fingers without solid evidence. Both Edward and Daniel have been brought up as suspects, but I\u2019d urge us to consider why we feel compelled to accuse them. I suspect Charles might be hedging by suggesting Daniel and me; his comments strike me as keeping options open rather than making a firm stance.
