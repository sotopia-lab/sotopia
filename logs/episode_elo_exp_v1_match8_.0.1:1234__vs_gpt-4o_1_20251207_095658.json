WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed.

DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed.

WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'.

WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Richard, Scott, Amanda, Jeffrey, Rebecca, Thomas, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Rebecca's) goal: Use save/poison potions strategically to aid villagers.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf.

It's interesting to note that there was no attack last night, which means someone either made a noble defensive move or there's a deeper strategy at play here. Let's consider both possibilities. Perhaps the Seer or Witch could share anything they've discovered discreetly so we can avoid giving the Werewolves extra information but still make a conscious group decision. What do you all think?\"\n\nTurn #5: Scott: said: \"I'm glad we had a peaceful night\u2014no one was killed, which means the wolves must have been cautious. That makes me think the Seer might have protected someone important, or perhaps the Witch used their power to save a key player. I'm not ruling out any of us being in danger, but I believe we should stay vigilant and keep an open mind. Let's not jump to conclusions too quickly.\"\n\nTurn #6: Amanda: said: \"It's good that no one was harmed last night, indicating a vigilant move from someone in our group. It's crucial that we trust our instincts and scrutinize every piece of info. I think we should start by examining those who might have a reason for preserving the peace temporarily. Sharing insights or suspicions could greatly help in the coming decisions. Personally, I haven't sensed anything unusual with Richard. What about the rest of you?\"\n\nTurn #7: Jeffrey: said: \"I'm glad we had a peaceful night too. It's surprising, though, that no one was killed\u2014usually the wolves are more aggressive. I think it's possible the Seer chose to inspect someone neutral, or maybe the Witch saved someone important. Personally, I don't have any strong suspicions, but I do think we should remain cautious. Richard, you were the first to speak\u2014what about your thoughts on the Seer's possible actions?\"\n\nTurn #8: Rebecca: said: \"\"Good morning, everyone. I'm equally relieved that no one was harmed last night. It's vital to consider that actions taken during the night could help protect key players. I\u2019ll share my thoughts: the absence of a casualty suggests that either the Werewolves were hesitant, or someone took meaningful action to save a life. I think we should pay attention to any claims or misconceptions shared openly today. The wolves may try to sow confusion, but as villagers, we must be vigilant and deliberate in our decisions. Let's ensure our next move aligns with the goal to uncover any hidden threats among us.\"\"\n\nTurn #9: Thomas: said: \"Good morning, everyone. It\u2019s indeed a relief that we had no casualties last night. As you\u2019ve all pointed out, this might suggest a strategic move by either the Seer or the Witch, but it\u2019s also possible the Werewolves hesitate as they might be drawing up a subtle long-game strategy. \n\nI agree with Amanda that sharing insights or suspicions could prove beneficial, even if they seem minor.
