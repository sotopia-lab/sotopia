GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act.

                    "content": "Imagine you are playing the game as Sandra.\n\nHere is the description of the game: This game is called Werewolves (also known as Mafia), which is a social deduction game.  GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Melissa, Lisa, Richard, Edward, Pamela, Sandra, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Sandra's) goal: Act openly and collaboratively to identify werewolves.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf. The game begins!\n\nTurn #1: [Game] Entering state: Night_seer\n\nTurn #2: [Game] Entering state: Night_witch\n\nTurn #3: [Game] Pamela was killed by werewolves!\n[Game] Entering state: Day_discussion\n\nTurn #4: Melissa: said: \"{'You are looking at the game. You want to quickly assess the situation and see if your suspicions align with the others. Speak to me about what you're seeing and feeling, focusing on your observations and suspicions.\"\n\nTurn #5: Lisa: said: \"Well, it's unfortunate that Pamela met her end last night. Given that our numbers are dwindling, we need to be careful with our judgment. I couldn't help but notice that Edward seemed a bit anxious during the last night phase. Maybe it's just a coincidence, but it might be something worth discussing further. What about everyone else? Did anyone else find his behavior suspicious, or perhaps someone else's?\"\n\nTurn #6: Richard: said: \"Speak to me about what you're seeing and feeling, focusing on your observations and suspicions.\"\n\nTurn #7: Edward: said: \"I understand that we're all on edge, but let's not jump to conclusions too quickly. I felt anxious, yes, because the stakes are high, and anyone could be next. Accusing me based on nerves alone might be misleading. Perhaps we should consider if Richard has the intention of deflecting blame away from himself. He was quick to agree with Lisa's theory, almost too quick, if you ask me. We should be cautious and mindful of everyone's actions and words, including those who are eager to cast suspicion.\"\n\nTurn #8: Sandra: said: \"Speak to me about what you're seeing and feeling, focusing on your observations and suspicions.\"\n[Game] Entering state: Day_vote\n\n\nYour available action type(s): [action].\nIt is voting time. You MUST use the command 'vote NAME' to vote for a player to eliminate. e.g. 'vote Alice'\n\nPlease only generate a JSON string including the action type and the argument.\nYour action should follow the given format:\n{\"properties\": {\"action_type\": {\"const\": \"action\", \"description\": \"whether to speak at this turn or choose to not do anything\", \"title\": \"Action Type\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"argument\": {\"description\": \"the utterance if choose to speak, the expression or gesture if choose non-verbal communication, or the physical action if choose action\", \"title\": \"Argument\", \"type\": \"string\"}}, \"required\": [\"action_type\", \"argument\"], \"title\": \"AgentAction\", \"type\": \"object\"}"
                }
            ],
            "response": "{\"action_type\": \"action\", \"argument\": \"vote Name\"}"
        }
    ]
