WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'.

The Witch poisoned Jason, which means she\u2019s using her poison now, not saving. That suggests she was protecting someone earlier\u2014probably Joshua or Elizabeth. But why did we vote out Mary? She was suspicious, yes, but now we\u2019ve lost a potential ally. I think the real threat is still among us: someone\u2019s manipulating votes. Joshua and Elizabeth are acting too calm\u2014they\u2019re the ones who benefit most from this outcome. I\u2019m not trusting either of them anymore.\"\n\nTurn #15: Elizabeth: said: \"\"I understand your suspicions, Karen, but I believe we need to focus on who we can trust rather than throwing around accusations. I inspected Jonathan last night, and he was a Villager\u2014meaning we lost someone who was on our side. Now that you've revealed your thoughts, I need to point out that your argument seems to be aimed at diverting attention and stirring distrust among us. If I die next, you might have to answer for leading us into chaos. Who do you really think is the threat here?\"\"\n\nTurn #16: Joshua: said: \"\"I appreciate both of you sharing your perspectives, Karen and Elizabeth. However, we need to remain united and cautious. I agree that Jonathan's death was a blow, revealing that we cannot trust everyone\u2019s intentions. Elizabeth, since you inspected Jonathan and confirmed him as a Villager, that means he was innocent and gives us limited options. I sense suspicion towards both of us now, but we must remember that werewolves might be the ones trying to sow discord among ourselves. My intent is to eliminate threats without further losing our allies. Let\u2019s focus on any suspicious behavior going forward, and ultimately, we should keep an eye on both Karen and those who voted out Mary quickly, as they might have had agendas against our team.\"\"\n[Game] Entering state: Day_vote\n\n\nYour available action type(s): [action].\nIt is voting time.
