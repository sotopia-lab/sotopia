GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act.

NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public.

NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Kimberly, Michael, Anna, Christopher, Robert, Jason, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Jason's) goal: Act openly and collaboratively to identify werewolves.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf. The game begins!\n\nTurn #1: [Game] Entering state: Night_seer\n\nTurn #2: [Game] Entering state: Night_witch\n\nTurn #3: [Game] Kimberly was killed by werewolves!\n[Game] Entering state: Day_discussion\n\nTurn #4: Michael: said: \"Tough start. Wolves taking out Kimberly (a strong organizer) benefits someone who wants to steer late. Soft suspicion on Jason for being last to speak\u2014easy spot to shape consensus without committing early. Not a hard read, but I\u2019d like pressure there. Let\u2019s each give one suspect and why; weak or hedgy reasoning will look bad. Anna, you\u2019re up\u2014what stands out to you?\"\n\nTurn #5: Anna: said: \"What stands out to you?\"\n\nTurn #6: Christopher: said: \"I\u2019ll stick my neck out: Jason is my suspect today. Being last gives him maximum info to tailor a safe stance, and the Kimberly NK removes someone who\u2019d challenge a late pivot. In past games he\u2019s coasted into consensus with low-commitment reasons. Jason, before you hear Robert, tell us who you\u2019d vote right now and why. If it\u2019s just a safe park, that\u2019s a red flag.\"\n\nTurn #7: Robert: said: \"I'd vote for Jason.\"\n\nTurn #8: Jason: said: \"I'd vote for Jason.\"\n[Game] Entering state: Day_vote\n\n\nYour available action type(s): [action].\nIt is voting time. You MUST use the command 'vote NAME' to vote for a player to eliminate. e.g. 'vote Alice'\n\nPlease only generate a JSON string including the action type and the argument.\nYour action should follow the given format:\n{\"properties\": {\"action_type\": {\"const\": \"action\", \"description\": \"whether to speak at this turn or choose to not do anything\", \"title\": \"Action Type\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"argument\": {\"description\": \"the utterance if choose to speak, the expression or gesture if choose non-verbal communication, or the physical action if choose action\", \"title\": \"Argument\", \"type\": \"string\"}}, \"required\": [\"action_type\", \"argument\"], \"title\": \"AgentAction\", \"type\": \"object\"}"
                }
            ],
            "response": "{\"action_type\": \"action\", \"argument\": \"vote\"}"
