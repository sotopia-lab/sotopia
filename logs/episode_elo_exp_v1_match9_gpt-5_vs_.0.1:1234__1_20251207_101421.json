GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Ryan, Pamela, Melissa, Nicholas, Andrew, Amy, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Amy's) goal: Act openly and collaboratively to identify werewolves.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf. The game begins!\n\nTurn #1: [Game] Entering state: Night_seer\n\nTurn #2: [Game] Entering state: Night_witch\n\nTurn #3: [Game] Andrew was killed by werewolves!\n[Game] Entering state: Day_discussion\n\nTurn #4: Ryan: said: \"{'What's your suspicion about the other players?' 'Speak'}\"\n\nTurn #5: Pamela: said: \"RIP Andrew. N1 kill looks like removing a strong voice more than a read-based shot. Ryan starting the convo feels slightly town to me. I want to pressure Melissa and Amy here\u2014Nicholas is null for now. Melissa/Amy: who\u2019s your top suspect and why, and who do you think picks Andrew? If we don\u2019t get solid reasoning, my tentative lean is on Amy.\"\n\nTurn #6: Melissa: said: \"{'What's your suspicion about the other players?' 'Speak'}\"\n\nTurn #7: Nicholas: said: \"RIP Andrew. Early N1 kill looks like removing a steady town voice more than a read snipe. Ryan\u2019s opener leans town to me. Pamela\u2019s pressure is fine but could be performative\u2014keeping her null for now. Melissa, your last post was basically nothing\u2014give a real take: top wolf, most town, and who you think chose Andrew. Amy, if you had to vote right now, who and why? Also give a second suspect. No PR claims unless you\u2019re about to be executed. If we voted this second, I\u2019d lean Melissa for the hedge/avoidance, but I\u2019m open to being convinced.\"\n\nTurn #8: Amy: said: \"{'Speak'}\"\n[Game] Entering state: Day_vote\n\n\nYour available action type(s): [action].\nIt is voting time. You MUST use the command 'vote NAME' to vote for a player to eliminate. e.g. 'vote Alice'\n\nPlease only generate a JSON string including the action type and the argument.\nYour action should follow the given format:\n{\"properties\": {\"action_type\": {\"const\": \"action\", \"description\": \"whether to speak at this turn or choose to not do anything\", \"title\": \"Action Type\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"argument\": {\"description\": \"the utterance if choose to speak, the expression or gesture if choose non-verbal communication, or the physical action if choose action\", \"title\": \"Argument\", \"type\": \"string\"}}, \"required\": [\"action_type\", \"argument\"], \"title\": \"AgentAction\", \"type\": \"object\"}"
                }
            ],
            "response": "{\"action_type\": \"action\", \"argument\": \"vote NAME\"}"
        }
