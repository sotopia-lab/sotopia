WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone.

Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Susan, Michael, Nicole, Kimberly, Brandon, Carol, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Nicole's) goal: Discreetly inspect players at night to uncover werewolves.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf.

This information is crucial. We should discuss who we suspect might be the werewolves based on previous discussions. Did anyone feel a certain tension or notice anything unusual about the other players' behavior?\"\n\nTurn #5: Michael: said: \"I think we should focus on the people who were targeted last night. Nicole was killed by Michael, and Carol was targeted by Kimberly. Since someone tried to attack and was prevented, it might be a sign of a hidden threat. I don't believe Nicole was a werewolf, but I'm not entirely sure. I suspect someone else might be hiding in plain sight. Let's keep an eye on the others.\"\n\nTurn #6: Nicole: said: \"\"I appreciate the input, Michael. It's important that we stay vigilant. I agree that we should consider the players who had a close call last night. I'm relieved that I wasn't the target, but this tension is palpable. Let's share our observations; it's essential that we combine our insights to identify any suspicious behavior.\"\"\n\nTurn #7: Kimberly: said: \"I'm glad we're all focusing on the night events. Nicole was targeted by Michael, and I was targeting Carol\u2014both of which were close calls. Since the attack was prevented, it's likely someone among us is hiding their true nature. I don't think Carol is a werewolf, but I can't rule out anyone. Let's keep an open mind and watch for inconsistencies in others' statements. I believe we need to be careful about who we trust, especially if someone is trying to manipulate the discussion.\"\n\nTurn #8: Brandon: said: \"\"I agree with what everyone has been saying. It's crucial we analyze the events from last night carefully. I saved Carol, which means I believe she is a valuable ally for us. I suspect there may be a werewolf hiding among those who were quiet or didn't contribute much to the discussion. We must remain vigilant and collaborate to uncover the true identities of the werewolves. Let's focus on potential inconsistencies in all of our statements, and I urge everyone to share their thoughts openly.\"\"\n\nTurn #9: Carol: said: \"I appreciate everyone's contributions so far. It seems clear that we need to closely analyze the events surrounding last night. I was targeted by Kimberly, and I trust Brandon's instinct as he saved me. Given the tensions, we should be wary of those who haven't shared much or who seem defensive.
