WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone.

Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Jonathan, Amy, Daniel, Jason, Donna, Cynthia, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Cynthia's) goal: Act openly and collaboratively to identify werewolves.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf. The game begins!\n\nTurn #1: [Game] Entering state: Night_seer\n\nTurn #2: [Game] Entering state: Night_witch\n\nTurn #3: [Game] Donna was killed by werewolves!\n[Game] Entering state: Day_discussion\n\nTurn #4: Jonathan: said: \"It's dawn and we just lost Donna to the werewolves. This is concerning, as we need to identify who among us might be responsible. We have to discuss what we all know and share any suspicions. It could give us a clearer direction on who to vote for today.\"\n\nTurn #5: Amy: said: \"Donna was a pretty quiet player, and I don't think she would have been a strong candidate for being a werewolf. But since she's gone, we need to be careful about who we trust. I'm not sure about anyone in particular, but I think Jason might be acting suspiciously\u2014his move to kill Cynthia feels out of place. Maybe he's trying to frame someone else, or he's just trying to hide something. I'll keep an eye on him.\"\n\nTurn #6: Daniel: said: \"I understand our concerns, and I agree that we need to be cautious. Amy, your observation about Jason is intriguing. However, I think we should also consider that unexpected moves can sometimes be desperate attempts to deflect suspicion. Personally, I inspected Jonathan last night, and he is not a werewolf. So perhaps we can start our discussion around others who may seem suspicious to us.\"\n\nTurn #7: Jason: said: \"Amy, I appreciate your suspicion about me, but let me clarify\u2014my move to kill Cynthia was a strategic choice. She was the only one who seemed to be openly questioning the group dynamics, and I believe she might have been trying to expose something. I'm not trying to frame anyone; I'm just trying to protect the group from potential threats. I'm confident in my judgment, and I stand by my actions.\"\n\nTurn #8: Cynthia: said: \"\"I appreciate everyone sharing their thoughts and suspicions. Jason, while I understand your reasoning, killing Cynthia does seem a bit extreme and could be seen as defensive. Let\u2019s not forget that we need to work together as a team. I know Daniel can confirm Jonathan\u2019s innocence, but I suspect we should keep an eye on anyone who seems overly defensive or dismissive. I believe we should gather more clues before we start casting blame. What does everyone else think?\"\"\n[Game] Entering state: Day_vote\n\nTurn #9: Jonathan: [action] vote Jason\nAmy: [action] vote Daniel\nDaniel: [action] vote Jason\nJason: [action] vote Daniel\nCynthia: [action] vote Jason\n[Game] Jason was voted out!\n[Game] Entering state: Night_werewolf\n\nTurn #10: [Game] Entering state: Night_seer\n\nTurn #11: [Game] Entering state: Night_witch\n\nTurn #12: [Game] Daniel was killed by werewolves!\n[Game] Entering state: Day_discussion\n\nTurn #13: Jonathan: said: \"\"It's dawn again, and sadly, we've lost Daniel to the werewolves. This is a critical moment for us. We need to reflect on the discussions we had before and rethink the process of elimination. Jason is already gone, and Daniel\u2019s innocence was clear. I\u2019d like to hear everyone's thoughts on who we should focus our suspicions on next. We need to remain vigilant and collaborative to find the remaining werewolves!\"\"\n\nTurn #14: Amy: said: \"Daniel was a strong player, and his elimination is deeply concerning. I believe he was not a werewolf, and his death may have been a mistake or a cover-up. However, I don\u2019t want to shift blame onto anyone else. I think we should stay cautious and not rush into voting. I suspect someone in the group is trying to manipulate the narrative\u2014maybe even someone who appears calm and reasonable. I\u2019ll keep an eye on Jonathan, as he seemed to have a clear inspection result. I don\u2019t trust his calmness, though he hasn\u2019t acted suspiciously yet. We need to dig deeper before we make another move.\"\n\nTurn #15: Cynthia: said: \"\"I echo what Jonathan and Amy have said. Losing Daniel is a huge blow to our team, as I believe we were working to identify the werewolves effectively. We have to remain cautious and consider every angle. I respect Jonathan's inspection result but Amy raises an important point about manipulation. We need to discuss everyone critically. Jason's actions were already noted, and now with Daniel out, we should also look closely at who may have been aligning themselves with such bold moves. Let\u2019s deliberate before diving into another vote; we must use this opportunity wisely.\"\"\n[Game] Entering state: Day_vote\n\n\nYour available action type(s): [action].\nIt is voting time.
