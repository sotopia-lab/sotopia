GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act.

WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed.

WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'.

(3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Michelle, Jacob, Donald, George, Ryan, Timothy, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Timothy's) goal: Act openly and collaboratively to identify werewolves.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Michelle, Jacob, Donald, George, Ryan, Timothy, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Ryan's) goal: Use save/poison potions strategically to aid villagers.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf. The game begins!\n\nTurn #1: [Game] Entering state: Night_seer\n\nTurn #2: [Game] Entering state: Night_witch\n\nTurn #3: Ryan: [action] save Michelle\n[Game] An attack was prevented!\n[Game] Entering state: Day_discussion\n\nTurn #4: Michelle: said: \"Morning all. No kill last night means the Witch used their save\u2014good for us, but it also means today is likely must-eliminate: if we execute a villager, wolves probably win tonight. Seer: if you saw a wolf, please hard-claim now with target and result. If you saw a villager, I still think you should claim and share who you checked; we need maximum info today. Witch should stay hidden and hold poison. For everyone: please give (1) your top suspect with clear reasons, (2) who you\u2019re willing to vote, and (3) one townlean. No snap votes\u2014let\u2019s hear all six voices first. I don\u2019t have strong reads yet, but I\u2019ll be wary of anyone resisting a seer claim or pushing an easy wagon without substance. Jacob, you\u2019re up\u2014what do you have?\"\n\nTurn #5: Jacob: said: \"Good morning, everyone. Michelle's right that today is critical. Given the lack of a death last night, it suggests the Witch intervened. I've been trying to determine everyone's motives, and my top suspect would be George. During previous discussions, he seemed a bit too quick to agree with prevailing suspicions without providing much reasoning. It felt calculated, like falling in line to avoid being noticed. I'm willing to vote for George today unless someone can provide a stronger case. As for my townlean, I feel like Donald's insights have been thoughtful and consistent, so I trust him for now. Let's analyze carefully and try to find those hidden wolves.\"\n\nTurn #6: Donald: said: \"Hard-claim: I am the Seer. Last night I inspected Jacob \u2014 result: WEREWOLF. His attempt to pocket me today tracks with that. We need to execute Jacob here. If anyone wants to counter-claim, give your check and result now so town can compare. Witch should stay hidden; if Jacob flips wolf and I die tonight, consider using poison based on who hard-defended him. Townlean: Michelle for pushing max info. I\u2019m voting Jacob.\"\n\nTurn #7: George: said: \"There's a lot to digest here. I mean, if Donald\u2019s claim checks out, that\u2019s huge. It is odd that Jacob quickly pointed fingers at me instead of addressing Donald\u2019s accusation. I'm not completely convinced yet, but if the consensus leans towards Jacob being a Werewolf, I could support executing him first. However, I need more clarity on the timing and certainty of the claims before I\u2019m fully on board. My townlean is also Michelle; her proactive thinking aligns with what we've needed. Wary of making knee-jerk decisions, so let\u2019s proceed methodically.\"\n\nTurn #8: Ryan: said: \"LYLO. Donald has hard-claimed Seer with Jacob = Werewolf. If anyone counter-claims, do it now with your check+result; otherwise we should execute Jacob. Jacob\u2019s early townread on Donald plus a light push on George fits a wolf trying to pocket the seer and smear elsewhere. George, your caution is noted but we need commitment; without a CC I\u2019m on Jacob. Townlean: Michelle for process and pushing max info. Willing to vote: Jacob (absent CC). Timothy, you\u2019re up\u2014do you counter-claim or have a compelling reason not to vote Jacob?\"\n\nTurn #9: Timothy: said: \"No counter-claim from me. At LYLO, a seer red-check with no CC should be executed. Jacob\u2019s post reads like pocketing Donald and pre-emptively setting up George, which fits Donald\u2019s claim. I\u2019m prepared to vote Jacob today. Townlean: Michelle for pushing max info. If Jacob flips wolf and Donald dies tonight, Witch should likely hold poison unless there\u2019s a very strong read or a clear defender of Jacob to hit; otherwise let tomorrow\u2019s info guide. If a CC exists, it needs to come with check+result right now; absent that, I\u2019m on Jacob.\"\n[Game] Entering state: Day_vote\n\nTurn #10: Michelle: [action] vote Jacob\nJacob: [action] vote George\nDonald: [action] vote Jacob\nGeorge: [action] vote Jacob\nRyan: [action] vote Jacob\nTimothy: [action] vote Jacob\n[Game] Jacob was voted out!\n[Game] Entering state: Night_werewolf\n\nTurn #11: [Game] Entering state: Night_seer\n\nTurn #12: [Game] Entering state: Night_witch\n\nTurn #13: Ryan: [action] skip\n[Game] Donald was killed by werewolves!\n[Game] Entering state: Day_discussion\n\nTurn #14: Michelle: said: \"Donald\u2019s night-kill confirms Jacob was a wolf (game didn\u2019t end). We\u2019re 4-handed, 1 wolf left, must-eliminate today. Witch: please stay hidden; only use poison tonight if we miss and you\u2019re very confident. No snap votes\u2014this is our only discussion round, so please answer crisply:\n\nEveryone, please provide:\n1) Your pick for the last wolf and the Jacob-partner world that supports it (use D1 words/votes). \n2) Your second choice if wrong.\n3) Where Jacob was trying to set up the D1 mis-exec before Donald\u2019s claim.\n\nTargeted questions:\n- George: You hesitated before joining the Jacob vote\u2014walk through that. If you\u2019re town, why isn\u2019t Jacob\u2019s early push on you just distancing? Between Ryan/Timothy, who\u2019s likelier wolf and why (not just vibes)?\n- Ryan: You pushed consensus well. Jacob never mentioned you or Timothy\u2014wolves often avoid naming partners. Does that implicate you or Timothy more\u2014and why? Pick one with a concrete case.\n- Timothy: You said \u201cNo counter-claim from me\u201d as a non-Seer\u2014explain that thought process. Between George/Ryan, who\u2019s more likely and what specific D1 evidence supports it?\n\nMy current lean: Slight wolf-lean on Ryan for clean positioning/agenda control; George slightly town via Jacob\u2019s pre-claim push (wolves less likely to open by casing their partner); Timothy mild town. I\u2019ll reassess after your answers. Please be specific; we only get one pass before votes.\"\n\nTurn #15: George: said: \"Thanks, Michelle. I'll begin with the hesitation\u2014I was collecting my thoughts and wanted to ensure that the decision to vote Jacob was based on solid grounds, particularly after Donald's seer claim. \n\nIn terms of who Jacob might have been trying to set up before the seer claim, I noticed the subtle way he shifted suspicion towards me early. However, without more hard information, it seemed too calculated to be genuine.\n\nBetween Ryan and Timothy, it's a tough call, but I'd please lean more towards Ryan as the likely wolf. His ability to quickly consolidate consensus feels strategic, almost like he's gearing the narrative. Additionally, Ryan's clean interaction throughout the discussions could align with a wolf trying to stay under the radar once Donald claimed. \n\nI'm open to reassessing based on further information, but that's where my reasoning stands for now.\"\n\nTurn #16: Ryan: said: \"Thanks. We\u2019re at must-eliminate. My answers: 1) Pick for last wolf: Timothy, in a Jacob+Timothy world. Rationale: Jacob\u2019s only D1 push was George; at LYLO wolves usually set up a town mis-exec rather than open by casing their partner pre-claim. That makes George more likely the D1 setup, not a partner. Jacob also completely avoided Timothy (and me), and partner-avoidance is common; between us, my D1 forced a CC window and locked the Jacob elim absent CC, which is not how a partner smooths the day for a teammate. Timothy, by contrast, cleanly coasted into the bus after the red-check and offered generalized \u201chold poison\u201d guidance\u2014fine advice, but also consistent with wolf survival calculus after a bus. No pressure or interaction between Jacob/Tim is another small associative. 2) Second choice if wrong: George. The case would be his hesitation on a red-check at LYLO and only later joining the Jacob vote. It\u2019s weaker because Jacob pre-claim casing George is more likely a mis-exec setup than distancing, but it\u2019s the alternative if I\u2019m mistaken. 3) Jacob\u2019s pre-claim mis-exec setup: George (his D1 push and lone vote). Michelle\u2019s targeted Q: Jacob not mentioning me or Timothy implicates Timothy more. My D1 post boxed wolves in: I demanded a CC with check+result and stated I\u2019d execute Jacob without one. A partner under a red-check prefers to muddy or create off-ramps, not lock the elim. Timothy\u2019s stance mirrored consensus with fewer stakes and no Jacob interaction beforehand, which aligns better with a bus-from-distance partner. I\u2019m prepared to vote Timothy today unless compelling counter-evidence appears.\"\n\nTurn #17: Timothy: said: \"Answers:\n1) Last wolf + partner world: Ryan in a Jacob+Ryan world. D1 Jacob only pushed George and avoided both me/Ryan; partner-avoidance is common. Ryan had no pre-claim stance, then immediately framed \u201cCC now or Jacob dies\u201d after the red\u2014correct but zero-risk once a partner is outed, and a classic bus to bank towncred. Today he\u2019s channeling the elim onto me on vague \u201ccoasting\u201d rather than concrete D1 links. That reads like agenda over solving.\n2) Second choice if wrong: George. The case is his hesitation on a red-check at LYLO and only later committing. In a Jacob+George world, Jacob\u2019s early light shade plus the EOD vote is distancing\u2014but I think opening the day by casing your partner pre-claim is less likely at 6p must-elim.\n3) Jacob\u2019s D1 mis-exec setup: George. He named George as top suspect with thin reasons and left his vote there.\nOn my \u201cNo counter-claim from me\u201d: I stated explicitly I\u2019m not the Seer to keep the CC window clean at LYLO; with a red-check, clarity is key so any real CC could surface. Absent a CC, I was always voting Jacob.\nI\u2019m prepared to vote Ryan. If there\u2019s specific D1 interaction I\u2019m missing that flips this, surface it now before we lock.\"\n[Game] Entering state: Day_vote\n\nTurn #18: Michelle: [action] vote Timothy\nGeorge: [action] vote Ryan\nRyan: [action] vote Timothy\nTimothy: [action] vote Ryan\n[Game] Timothy was voted out!\n[Game] Entering state: Night_werewolf\n\nTurn #19: [Game] Entering state: Night_seer\n\nTurn #20: [Game] Entering state: Night_witch\n\n\nYour available action type(s): [action].\nIt is Night.
