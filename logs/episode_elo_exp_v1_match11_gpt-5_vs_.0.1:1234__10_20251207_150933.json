WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'.

WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Mary, Kimberly, Joseph, Nicole, Charles, Eric, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Joseph's) goal: Discreetly inspect players at night to uncover werewolves.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf.

I'm not sure who it is, but I think we should focus on discussing the night actions and looking for patterns. Since Charles was killed, we need to consider who might have been targeted. I'm open to hearing everyone's thoughts on who could be a werewolf.\"\n\nTurn #5: Kimberly: said: \"Ugh, poor Charles. No witch save and no poison, so we just have the single night kill.

Joseph and Eric\u2014who benefits from taking out Charles, and who are you willing to vote today? Nicole, do you agree with Mary\u2019s approach, and who does it actually point to? If the Seer hit a wolf, consider outing that now; otherwise stay hidden. I\u2019m not locking a vote yet, but I\u2019m side-eyeing anyone who stays vague or just piggybacks without reasons.\"\n\nTurn #6: Joseph: said: \"I inspected Eric last night, and he is a villager. Charles was killed by the werewolves, so I believe the wolves are likely targeting someone else. I\u2019m not voting yet, but I will keep an eye on Nicole and Kimberly\u2014both of whom have been active in the discussion. If the witch had saved someone, it might have been a wolf, but since no save or poison was used, the kill was likely done by wolves. I trust the group\u2019s discussion to identify the next suspect, but I\u2019ll be cautious about naming anyone without solid evidence.\"\n\nTurn #7: Nicole: said: \"RIP Charles.

Joseph, thank you for inspecting me and confirming I am a villager \u2014 that adds clarity and supports the trust in the Seer's action.

Since Charles was killed by wolves and no save or poison was used, it's consistent with the wolves having killed him directly.
