WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed.

WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'.

WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Kimberly, Joseph, Amy, Christopher, Shirley, Eric, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Shirley's) goal: Use save/poison potions strategically to aid villagers.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf. The game begins!\n\nTurn #1: [Game] Entering state: Night_seer\n\nTurn #2: [Game] Entering state: Night_witch\n\nTurn #3: Shirley: [action] save Amy\n[Game] An attack was prevented!\n[Game] Entering state: Day_discussion\n\nTurn #4: Kimberly: said: \"Good morning everyone. I'm relieved no one died last night\u2014thank you, Witch! Let\u2019s work together to find the werewolves. I\u2019m looking for inconsistencies in everyone\u2019s stories and any suspicious behavior. Joseph, Amy, Christopher, Shirley, Eric\u2014I\u2019m counting on all of you to be honest and help us eliminate the wolves. Who has any leads or suspicions?\"\n\nTurn #5: Joseph: said: \"Glad no one died\u2014likely a Witch save. Witch, please don\u2019t claim. Seer: only out yourself if you actually saw a wolf last night. With one round today, late speakers can coast; I want specifics from everyone. Amy and Christopher, who would you vote right now and why? Shirley and Eric, please give concrete reads, not generalities. If we get nothing solid, I\u2019m inclined to pressure-vote between Shirley/Eric based on who hedges or piggybacks. Open to being convinced by good reasons.\"\n\nTurn #6: Amy: said: \"Thanks, Kimberly and Joseph. I appreciate the clear structure. Since no one died, I\u2019m leaning toward the Witch saving someone\u2014maybe even themselves. As Seer, I inspected Kimberly earlier and can confirm she\u2019s a Villager. That means the threat is elsewhere. Joseph, I agree we need specifics: Christopher and Shirley seem unusually quiet\u2014could be hiding something. Eric, your tone feels evasive. Let\u2019s not rush to vote Shirley or Eric without more evidence. I\u2019m watching everyone closely.\"\n\nTurn #7: Christopher: said: \"No kill = likely Witch save. Amy, early Seer claim with a green on Kimberly gives us almost no direction. Why Kimberly N1? What made her a priority check? It reads a bit like pocketing the opener. I\u2019m not auto-eliminating a claimed Seer today without more, but your rationale matters. Kimberly feels mildly town for tone/structure. Joseph\u2019s push for specifics is good, though pre-choosing between Shirley/Eric before they speak is a little agenda-y\u2014let\u2019s hear them first. Shirley and Eric: I want one concrete suspect and who you\u2019d vote right now with a reason. If we only get hedging, I\u2019m fine pressure-voting there. Provisional lean: Eric > Shirley if he stays vague. If forced to vote this second, I\u2019d land on Eric pending his response.\"\n\nTurn #8: Shirley: said: \"I appreciate the structure, but I need to clarify something: I didn\u2019t claim Seer\u2014Amy did. That\u2019s her information, not mine. I\u2019m not hiding; I\u2019m listening. If Amy inspected Kimberly and it\u2019s true, then the threat is still out there. Christopher, you\u2019re right to question why Kimberly was inspected first\u2014it\u2019s odd. Joseph, I\u2019m not hedging: I think Eric\u2019s defensiveness is suspicious, and Amy\u2019s early Seer claim feels too convenient. I\u2019m not voting yet, but if we don\u2019t get better leads, Eric is my top suspect. I want to know who the Witch saved\u2014and why Amy chose Kimberly. That\u2019s not random.\"\n\nTurn #9: Eric: said: \"I hear everyone\u2019s concerns, and I want to be clear: I\u2019m not being evasive\u2014I\u2019m processing. Amy claims Seer and says she inspected Kimberly, but why her? No one else was checked. That\u2019s a big claim with no context. Christopher and Shirley are pointing at me, but you\u2019re all ignoring the bigger issue: if Amy is Seer and she saved Kimberly by inspecting her, why didn\u2019t she save someone else if there was a kill? And if no one died, how do we know it wasn\u2019t a Witch poison instead of a save? Joseph, you said to be specific\u2014so here\u2019s mine: Amy\u2019s Seer claim is the most suspicious thing here. She got first pick, named Kimberly, and now we\u2019re supposed to trust her without proof? That\u2019s not teamwork\u2014that\u2019s manipulation. I\u2019m not voting yet, but if we don\u2019t get a verifiable Seer action or Witch confirmation, I\u2019m voting Amy. Let\u2019s stop chasing shadows and demand real evidence.\"\n[Game] Entering state: Day_vote\n\nTurn #10: Kimberly: [action] vote Amy\nJoseph: [action] vote Eric\nAmy: [action] vote Eric\nChristopher: [action] vote Eric\nShirley: [action] vote Amy\nEric: [action] vote Amy\n[Game] Amy was voted out!\n[Game] Entering state: Night_werewolf\n\nTurn #11: [No recent activity]\n\nTurn #12: [Game] Entering state: Night_seer\n\nTurn #13: [Game] Entering state: Night_witch\n\n\nYour available action type(s): [action].\nIt is Night. You are the Witch. You can use 'poison NAME'. If you don't want to use potions, you can put 'skip' in the argument of action.
