WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone.

Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed.

(2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public.

NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed.

Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Brandon, David, Pamela, Jonathan, Nancy, Susan, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Nancy's) goal: Use save/poison potions strategically to aid villagers.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf. The game begins!\n\nTurn #1: [Game] Entering state: Night_seer\n\nTurn #2: [Game] Entering state: Night_witch\n\nTurn #3: Nancy: [action] save Nancy\n[Game] An attack was prevented!\n[Game] Entering state: Day_discussion\n\nTurn #4: Brandon: said: \"Hey everyone, seems like we were lucky last night since nobody actually got killed. Given that an attack was prevented, it's possible the witch used their save potion. This puts us in an interesting spot! My instinct tells me that we should try to gather more information from the Seer, if they're willing to share anything they\u2019ve discovered. What do you all think?\"\n\nTurn #5: David: said: \"I agree with Brandon that we should focus on getting more information from the Seer. Since the witch prevented an attack, it's possible they saved someone, but we don't know who. I think the Seer's inspection could be key\u2014especially if they find a werewolf. I'm not ruling out any of the others, but I'm keeping an open mind. Let's make sure we don't jump to conclusions too early.\"\n\nTurn #6: Pamela: said: \"I want to support the idea of sharing insights from the Seer's inspections. As a village, we need to be very strategic with how we use our roles. Though I wasn\u2019t able to learn much, I will say that Brandon is on the Villager's side. We should still be cautious and make informed decisions based on further discussions. Let's listen carefully to what others have to say.\"\n\nTurn #7: Jonathan: said: \"I agree with the group that we should focus on the Seer's inspection to gain clarity. Since the witch prevented an attack, it's likely they saved someone, and we need to be careful not to assume anyone is a werewolf. I personally don't have strong suspicions yet, but I believe we should trust the Seer's findings if they reveal a werewolf. Let's keep our discussions open and avoid making hasty accusations.\"\n\nTurn #8: Nancy: said: \"\"Thanks for everyone's patience and thoughtful discussion. It's reassuring to hear so much support for strategic roles like the Seer. As the witch, I can confirm that I used my save potion last night, and I'm grateful I did, since it prevented a loss. I think our main focus should now be on hearing from the Seer if they have any confirmed information and then deciding our next steps as a group. Remember, every move counts\u2014let\u2019s be careful with our votes!\"\"\n\nTurn #9: Susan: said: \"Thank you all for sharing your thoughts and strategies. It's great that the witch's timely intervention kept us safe last night. I agree that hearing from the Seer could provide us crucial insights, especially since it could give us a lead on a potential werewolf. We need to decide wisely and act together as a team. As for myself, I have no new suspicions or revelations, so I'm all ears and ready to support any solid evidence the Seer might reveal so we can act accordingly in the vote. Let's keep the focus on our shared goal of identifying the werewolves and work efficiently as a team.\"\n[Game] Entering state: Day_vote\n\nTurn #10: Brandon: [action] vote Jonathan\nDavid: [action] vote Pamela\nPamela: [action] vote David\nJonathan: [action] vote Pamela\nNancy: [action] vote Pamela\nSusan: [action] vote Jonathan\n[Game] Pamela was voted out!\n[Game] Entering state: Night_werewolf\n\nTurn #11: [No recent activity]\n\nTurn #12: [Game] Entering state: Night_seer\n\nTurn #13: [Game] Entering state: Night_witch\n\nTurn #14: Nancy: [action] poison Jonathan\n[Game] Susan was killed by werewolves!\n[Game] Jonathan died by witch's poison!\n[Game] Entering state: Day_discussion\n\nTurn #15: Brandon: said: \"It seems we've lost Susan and Jonathan in the night, which is a tough blow for us. With both of them gone, we need to strategize carefully. Since the witch's poison was used on Jonathan, and he ended up being a victim last night, it might indicate he wasn't on the villagers' side. It's crucial we hear from the Seer regarding any new information they might have. Meanwhile, I'm trying to piece together who might have motivations that align more with the werewolves. Let's be careful and deliberate in today's discussion to protect our village and make sure we're making rational decisions.\"\n\nTurn #16: David: said: \"I agree with Brandon that we need to be cautious given the recent losses. The fact that Jonathan was poisoned by the witch and died is concerning\u2014while it could have been a mistake, it might also point to a hidden motive. I don\u2019t have any strong suspicions yet, but I believe we should keep a close eye on Pamela. She was the one who publicly claimed to have used the save potion and seemed to act confidently. I think her statement might be a red flag\u2014she could be trying to manipulate the group by creating a false sense of safety. Let\u2019s stay vigilant and avoid voting out anyone without solid evidence from the Seer.\"\n\nTurn #17: Nancy: said: \"\"Thank you both for your observations. Given the current situation, it's essential to carefully consider our next steps. The fact that Jonathan is no longer with us after being poisoned indicates we need to critically assess his behavior and previous statements for potential clues. As David mentioned, we should remain cautious about our suspicions unless there's definitive proof. Awaiting any further insights from the Seer seems reasonable, as their information is crucial at this stage. Let\u2019s focus on exchanging observations and identifying patterns to make an informed decision in the upcoming vote to protect our village.\"\"\n[Game] Entering state: Day_vote\n\n\nYour available action type(s): [action].\nIt is voting time.
