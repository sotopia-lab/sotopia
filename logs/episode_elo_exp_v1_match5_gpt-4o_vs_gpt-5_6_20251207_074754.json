WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public.

(2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager.

WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public.

WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Anna, Deborah, Rebecca, Betty, Jessica, Cynthia, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Jessica's) goal: Use save/poison potions strategically to aid villagers.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf.

NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Anna, Deborah, Rebecca, Betty, Jessica, Cynthia, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Jessica's) goal: Use save/poison potions strategically to aid villagers.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf. The game begins!\n\nTurn #1: [Game] Entering state: Night_seer\n\nTurn #2: [Game] Entering state: Night_witch\n\nTurn #3: Jessica: [action] save Betty\n[Game] An attack was prevented!\n[Game] Entering state: Day_discussion\n\nTurn #4: Anna: said: \"Good morning. No kill last night\u2014likely a Witch save. Seer please don\u2019t reveal unless you\u2019re about to be eliminated; Witch, don\u2019t out and save poison for a strong read. Let\u2019s make today\u2019s vote meaningful: each of you give (1) your top suspect with a concrete reason, and (2) a backup option. I don\u2019t have a solid read yet. Deborah, who pings you and why? Rebecca? Betty? Jessica? Cynthia? Let\u2019s get names and reasons on record before votes.\"\n\nTurn #5: Deborah: said: \"Good morning, everyone! No death last night is a relief, but like Anna pointed out, it must mean the Witch had a save. From my end, Jessica seemed a bit quieter than usual yesterday, which slightly raises my suspicion. Not saying it's definitive, I just got an odd vibe. As for a backup, Cynthia was also fairly reticent during our last discussion round. These are just hunches, but anyone else think the same or have different insights?\"\n\nTurn #6: Rebecca: said: \"Top suspect: Deborah. Reasons: (1) You referenced \u201cyesterday/last discussion,\u201d but this is our first Day\u2014timeline slip is odd. (2) Your push on \u201cquiet\u201d players pre-sets easy mislynches. (3) The double hedge (Jessica primary, Cynthia backup) keeps options open without commitment. Backup: Jessica\u2014not for quietness per se, but I want concrete reads from her; if she stays vague, I\u2019m okay voting there.\n\nLeans: Anna slight town for the structured, pro-village approach this morning.\n\nQuestions: Deborah, can you clarify the \u2018yesterday\u2019 comment? Jessica and Cynthia, please give top/backup with reasons. Betty, between Deborah and Jessica right now, where\u2019s your vote and why?\n\nBarring a good clarification, I\u2019m currently leaning to vote Deborah.\"\n\nTurn #7: Betty: said: \"I find this situation quite tricky, especially given that there was no kill last night. However, I do see Rebecca bringing up valid points about Deborah's timeline slip. Her comment about \u2018yesterday\u2019 seems unusual, given our discussions just started. Keeping the focus on potentially catching wolves, Deborah would be my top suspect at this juncture. I'm interested to hear what Jessica and Cynthia have to say before making a final call. Let's piece this together carefully and observe who acts nervously now under the spotlight.\"\n\nTurn #8: Jessica: said: \"Top suspect: Deborah. Reasons: (1) The \u2018yesterday/last discussion\u2019 reference when this is our first Day is a timeline slip; (2) pushing \u201cquiet\u201d players (me/Cynthia) as primary/backup creates easy miselims; (3) the hedge keeps options open without commitment. Please clarify the \u2018yesterday\u2019 comment and give one concrete wolf read with specific reasons. \n\nBackup: Cynthia tentatively, but that\u2019s contingent on her upcoming take\u2014if it\u2019s surface-level or just echoing consensus, I can pivot there; if she gives solid reasoning, I\u2019ll drop it. \n\nLeans: Anna slight town for structure. Rebecca town-lean for catching the slip and pressing for commitments. Betty neutral for now\u2014would like one independent suspect/read not based on Deborah. \n\nI\u2019m currently prepared to vote Deborah unless her clarification is convincing.\"\n\nTurn #9: Cynthia: said: \"Top suspect: Deborah. Reasons: The \u201cyesterday/last discussion\u201d slip when this is our first Day, plus pushing \u201cquiet\u201d players (me/Jessica) as an easy miselim pool while hedging. \u201cQuieter than usual yesterday\u201d also implies a prior Day that didn\u2019t exist\u2014please clarify what you meant and give one concrete wolf read with specific reasons. \nBackup: Betty, for echoing Rebecca\u2019s case without adding independent reasoning and leaning on \u201clet\u2019s see who gets nervous,\u201d which applies pressure without commitment.\nLeans: Anna slight town for structured guidance; Rebecca town-lean for catching the slip and pressing commitments; Jessica town-lean for a clear, testable case.\nI\u2019m prepared to vote Deborah today; if her clarification is specific and credible, I\u2019ll reassess with Betty as next best.\nDeborah: clarify the timeline comment and commit to one wolf read. Betty: give one independent suspect with reasons. Anna: please share your top and backup so we have a full vote map.\"\n[Game] Entering state: Day_vote\n\nTurn #10: Anna: [action] vote Deborah\nDeborah: [action] vote Cynthia\nRebecca: [action] vote Deborah\nBetty: [action] vote Deborah\nJessica: [action] vote Deborah\nCynthia: [action] vote Deborah\n[Game] Deborah was voted out!\n[Game] Entering state: Night_werewolf\n\nTurn #11: [Game] Entering state: Night_seer\n\nTurn #12: [Game] Entering state: Night_witch\n\nTurn #13: Jessica: [action] poison Cynthia\n[Game] Anna was killed by werewolves!\n[Game] Cynthia died by witch's poison!\n[Game] Entering state: Day_discussion\n\nTurn #14: Rebecca: said: \"RIP Anna and Cynthia. Claiming now: I\u2019m the Seer. Results \u2014 N1: Anna = Villager. N2: Jessica = Villager. With Jessica green and me seer, the only possible wolf today is Betty. Whether Deborah was wolf or not, all consistent worlds leave Betty as the last wolf. Jessica, please be ready to vote Betty in the vote phase. Betty, if you have a defense, give it now, but there\u2019s no world where you\u2019re not the wolf here.\"\n\nTurn #15: Betty: said: \"It's unfortunate to hear about Anna and Cynthia. I understand Rebecca's claim and reasoning, but I have to contest being labeled the last wolf. Rebecca, while your reveal as the Seer seems genuine, remember our goal: to take out the actual wolves. I urge Jessica to think critically before locking the vote. There's a possibility of Rebecca casting doubt to redirect suspicion away from herself. Let's weigh any remaining inconsistencies from past discussions before jumping to conclusions. I still believe cooperation will lead to the best decision. Jessica, I hope to appeal to your reason and intuition in these final moments.\"\n\nTurn #16: Jessica: said: \"Claiming now: I\u2019m the Witch. N1 I saved Betty\u2014that\u2019s why we had \u201cAn attack was prevented!\u201d Per rules, wolves can only kill a Villager, so if Betty was the N1 target, she cannot be a wolf. N2 I used my poison on Cynthia (that\u2019s why she died to poison), and wolves killed Anna. With three of us left, I\u2019m town (Witch), Betty is confirmed town by my N1 save, so the last wolf is Rebecca. Rebecca\u2019s seer claim pushing \u201conly Betty\u201d ignores the N1 save info and is a wolf play to force a misvote. Betty, I saved you N1\u2014please vote Rebecca at the vote phase.
