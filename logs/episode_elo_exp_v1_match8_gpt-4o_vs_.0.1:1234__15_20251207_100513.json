GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public.

Mark was a villager, and his death confirms that werewolves were active \u2014 that\u2019s a key point. I don\u2019t have any specific suspicions yet, but I do want to emphasize the importance of trust and collaboration. Let\u2019s keep an open mind and use all the information we have. I\u2019m particularly interested in hearing more about the dynamics between Jonathan and Melissa, as well as any insights from Kathleen about her observations.\"\n[Game] Entering state: Day_vote\n\nTurn #9: Jonathan: [action] vote Anna\nAnna: [action] vote Jonathan\nMelissa: [action] vote Anna\nKathleen: [action] vote Jonathan\nPamela: [action] vote Jonathan\n[Game] Jonathan was voted out!\n[Game] Entering state: Night_werewolf\n\nTurn #10: [Game] Entering state: Night_seer\n\nTurn #11: [Game] Entering state: Night_witch\n\nTurn #12: [Game] An attack was prevented!\n[Game] Entering state: Day_discussion\n\nTurn #13: Anna: said: \"Melissa was identified as a werewolf through the night inspection, and her involvement in the previous night's events confirms her role. I believe this information strengthens our understanding of the group dynamics. While I remain cautious about further accusations, I think it's important to continue monitoring the remaining suspects, especially Jonathan and Pamela, who have shown inconsistent behavior during the day. We must stay vigilant and rely on facts, not assumptions.\"\n\nTurn #14: Melissa: said: \"I'm surprised by the bold claim, Anna. We know that information can easily be manipulated in this game, and we should question the reliability of it. I haven't been involved in anything suspicious other than defending myself from baseless accusations, similar to the ones being made now. My intention has always been to get to the truth behind Mark's death, and I urge everyone to carefully consider Anna's motives. Why shift the focus to me today? Let's not let misinformation lead to hasty decisions.\"\n\nTurn #15: Kathleen: said: \"Anna, I appreciate your statement, but I want to clarify that Melissa was not identified as a werewolf through any night inspection. The seer's actions are private and not shared with the players, so any claims about Melissa being a werewolf are unfounded. I trust the process and believe we should focus on evidence, not assumptions. I still feel Pamela has been cautious and observant, and I\u2019d like to see more from her during the discussion. Let\u2019s keep our suspicions grounded in facts and avoid spreading misinformation.\"\n\nTurn #16: Pamela: said: \"Thank you, Kathleen, for clarifying that the seer did not identify Melissa as a werewolf. I completely agree that we must rely on verified information and avoid spreading unconfirmed claims. I\u2019ve been listening carefully throughout the discussion and remain cautious about forming any suspicions. I trust that the group will continue to work together with honesty and transparency. I\u2019d like to hear more from everyone about their observations and thoughts, especially regarding the dynamics between Jonathan and Pamela, as their behavior during the day has been notable. Let\u2019s keep our focus on facts and ensure we don\u2019t jump to conclusions based on emotion or assumptions.\"\n[Game] Entering state: Day_vote\n\n\nYour available action type(s): [action].\nIt is voting time.
