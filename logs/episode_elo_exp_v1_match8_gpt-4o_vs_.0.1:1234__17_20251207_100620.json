GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act.

NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Christopher, Jessica, Margaret, Brian, George, Shirley, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Shirley's) goal: Act openly and collaboratively to identify werewolves.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf. The game begins!\n\nTurn #1: [Game] Entering state: Night_seer\n\nTurn #2: [Game] Entering state: Night_witch\n\nTurn #3: [Game] Brian was killed by werewolves!\n[Game] Entering state: Day_discussion\n\nTurn #4: Christopher: said: \"Brian was killed by the werewolves during the night. I'm not sure who else might be a werewolf, but we need to be careful about our suspicions. Since Brian is gone, we should focus on discussing who might have been targeted and whether anyone else seems out of place. Let's keep an open mind and share any observations we have.\"\n\nTurn #5: Jessica: said: \"I can't believe Brian's gone already! It's so suspicious how things happen quickly here. To me, it felt almost orchestrated. What do you think, Margaret? Had Brian mentioned anything particular before we started playing? We might find a clue about who he's suspected.\"\n\nTurn #6: Margaret: said: \"I didn't know Brian before the game started, so I don't have any personal observations about him. However, his death during the night was unexpected, and it's worth noting that the werewolves would likely target someone they suspect is a villager. Since Brian was killed, I believe it's important to keep an open discussion about who might be a werewolf. I'm not ruling out anyone yet, but I'll keep an eye on any suspicious behavior or inconsistencies during the day.\"\n\nTurn #7: George: said: \"I'm glad we're discussing the situation openly. Brian's death is a big shock, and it's clear the werewolves acted quickly. Since I used the save potion on Margaret, I believe she is likely a villager. If Margaret were a werewolf, she would have been targeted earlier or her identity would have been exposed. I'm not suspecting anyone else yet, but I'll keep an eye on any inconsistencies in the day's behavior. Let's stay vigilant and focus on building trust through discussion.\"\n\nTurn #8: Shirley: said: \"I appreciate George's point about using the save potion on Margaret \u2014 that's a solid piece of information. Since Margaret was saved, it strengthens the idea that she's a villager. I also want to add that Brian's sudden death makes me think the werewolves might have targeted someone who was either isolated or seemed like a potential threat. I\u2019m not making any direct accusations, but I\u2019ll keep a close eye on anyone who seems to act differently or makes inconsistent statements. Let\u2019s continue this open and respectful discussion to figure out who might be a werewolf.\"\n[Game] Entering state: Day_vote\n\nTurn #9: Christopher: [action] vote George\nJessica: [action] vote George\nMargaret: [action] vote George\nGeorge: [action] vote Jessica\nShirley: [action] vote George\n[Game] George was voted out!\n[Game] Entering state: Night_werewolf\n\nTurn #10: [Game] Entering state: Night_seer\n\nTurn #11: [Game] Entering state: Night_witch\n\nTurn #12: [Game] Christopher was killed by werewolves!\n[Game] Entering state: Day_discussion\n\nTurn #13: Jessica: said: \"Wow, it looks like the werewolves have targeted our group fiercely. With Christopher gone too, this is getting quite intense. It's important for everyone to share anything suspicious they've noticed. Considering what George said about saving Margaret, and with him being out, we might need to be careful about anyone trying to mislead us. Shirley, what do you think we should focus on next to uncover a werewolf? We have to work closely together if we're going to figure this out.\"\n\nTurn #14: Margaret: said: \"I'm glad we're all being transparent in our discussion.
