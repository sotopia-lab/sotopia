WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed.

WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'.

WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Ronald, Kimberly, Nicholas, Joseph, Jessica, Justin, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Joseph's) goal: Deceive others, avoid detection, and eliminate villagers.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf.

This suggests that either the Witch saved a Villager or the Werewolves tried to target a protected player. Let's discuss who we suspect might be Werewolves and why.\"\n\nTurn #5: Kimberly: said: \"Wild start. Feels like the Witch burned the save, so no kill. That means tonight we\u2019re more exposed, so we need a solid vote today. Ronald, your opener is very safe and agenda-setting without a read\u2014slight ping for steering without stakes. I\u2019d like concrete suspects from you. Also want Nicholas and Justin to give early reads; wolves love to coast Day 1. Seer: only out if you hit a wolf; otherwise stay quiet. Right now I\u2019m leaning Ronald or Nicholas, but I\u2019ll adjust after hearing everyone.\"\n\nTurn #6: Nicholas: said: \"I agree with Kimberly, we need to be vigilant moving forward. I think it's crucial we all share our thoughts. I inspected Ronald last night, and he's a Villager. That said, I do find it suspicious that Kimberly seems to be redirecting discussions toward Ronald. I'm interested to hear more about Justin's takes as well. What do you think, Justin?\"\n\nTurn #7: Joseph: said: \"Wild night. If an attack was prevented, it\u2019s likely the Witch burned the save, so today\u2019s vote matters a lot.\n\nNicholas: bold to out with just a Ronald green. If you\u2019re Seer, thanks, but why claim now\u2014were you under pressure or just anchoring the day? Either way, I\u2019m not voting Ronald today.\n\nKimberly: your push on Ronald/Nicholas came before the claim. Now that Ronald is reportedly green, where do you stand? Who\u2019s your updated top suspect and why?\n\nFor me, best info today comes from the quieter slots. Jessica and Justin, I want concrete reads and a preferred elim. My pool is between you two unless something changes. Justin, especially want your take on Nick\u2019s claim and on Kimberly\u2019s early push.\"\n\nTurn #8: Jessica: said: \"I think we should focus on the quieter players today. Joseph, I agree that our votes must be strategic now that we know Ronald is a Villager. My main concern lies with how quickly Kimberly has zeroed in on Ronald without assessing other players. Justin, since you are also quiet, I'm curious about your reads on all this. Let's not forget the power of the Witch\u2014if they saved Ronald, it could put a target on them next. We should discuss our thoughts openly about who may be the remaining werewolves. My suspicion leans towards Kimberly and possibly Justin as well, depending on their responses.\"\n\nTurn #9: Justin: said: \"\"Thanks for the insights, everyone.

(3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Ronald, Kimberly, Nicholas, Joseph, Jessica, Justin, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Ronald's) goal: Act openly and collaboratively to identify werewolves.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf.

That means tonight we\u2019re more exposed, so we need a solid vote today. Ronald, your opener is very safe and agenda-setting without a read\u2014slight ping for steering without stakes. I\u2019d like concrete suspects from you. Also want Nicholas and Justin to give early reads; wolves love to coast Day 1. Seer: only out if you hit a wolf; otherwise stay quiet. Right now I\u2019m leaning Ronald or Nicholas, but I\u2019ll adjust after hearing everyone.\"\n\nTurn #6: Nicholas: said: \"I agree with Kimberly, we need to be vigilant moving forward. I think it's crucial we all share our thoughts. I inspected Ronald last night, and he's a Villager. That said, I do find it suspicious that Kimberly seems to be redirecting discussions toward Ronald. I'm interested to hear more about Justin's takes as well. What do you think, Justin?\"\n\nTurn #7: Joseph: said: \"Wild night.

Joseph, I agree that our votes must be strategic now that we know Ronald is a Villager. My main concern lies with how quickly Kimberly has zeroed in on Ronald without assessing other players. Justin, since you are also quiet, I'm curious about your reads on all this. Let's not forget the power of the Witch\u2014if they saved Ronald, it could put a target on them next. We should discuss our thoughts openly about who may be the remaining werewolves. My suspicion leans towards Kimberly and possibly Justin as well, depending on their responses.\"\n\nTurn #9: Justin: said: \"\"Thanks for the insights, everyone. I agree with the sentiment that we should be vigilant. Nicholas's claim about Ronald being a Villager is bold, and I appreciate the transparency, but it makes me question Nicholas's motives\u2014did he feel pressure or is he trying to lead us somewhere? As for Kimberly, her early push on Ronald does raise some suspicion as it feels a bit opportunistic. I suspect she may be trying to steer the conversation away from herself. I also acknowledge Jessica's points about the quieter players. For now, I\u2019m leaning towards Kimberly as my top suspect due to her aggressive stance on Ronald and lack of broader assessment.

He was a strong ally and his read on me was crucial. I still stand by my innocence, so we need to focus our attention. I hope the Seer can share their insights soon and the Witch still has their resources for protection. Looking at today's numbers, we need to consider both Joseph and Jessica, who have remained quiet compared to others. I urge everyone to share their thoughts again.

What does matter is D1 positioning. Ronald was greenchecked; I\u2019m not voting him. My strongest suspect is Jessica. Her D1 hedged hard: agreed broadly about focusing on quiet slots, shaded both Kimberly and Justin without committing, and crucially flagged the Witch (\u201cif they saved Ronald, it could put a target on them next\u201d). That reads like role-fishing/setting up night priorities, which is wolfy right after a prevented kill. Combine that with a very safe vote onto the leading wagon and I see scum equity there.

First, I resonate with Joseph's sentiments regarding Jessica. Her previous actions seemed opportunistic and have raised my suspicion toward her. The fact that she was quick to target both Kimberly and myself while keeping a safe distance from other players is concerning. I would also like to point out that while it\u2019s easy to follow the obvious narratives, we need to remain vigilant on all fronts as the dynamics shift.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Ronald, Kimberly, Nicholas, Joseph, Jessica, Justin, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Justin's) goal: Act openly and collaboratively to identify werewolves.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf. The game begins!\n\nTurn #1: [Game] Entering state: Night_seer\n\nTurn #2: [Game] Entering state: Night_witch\n\nTurn #3: [Game] An attack was prevented!\n[Game] Entering state: Day_discussion\n\nTurn #4: Ronald: said: \"It seems that an attack was prevented last night. This suggests that either the Witch saved a Villager or the Werewolves tried to target a protected player. Let's discuss who we suspect might be Werewolves and why.\"\n\nTurn #5: Kimberly: said: \"Wild start. Feels like the Witch burned the save, so no kill. That means tonight we\u2019re more exposed, so we need a solid vote today. Ronald, your opener is very safe and agenda-setting without a read\u2014slight ping for steering without stakes. I\u2019d like concrete suspects from you. Also want Nicholas and Justin to give early reads; wolves love to coast Day 1. Seer: only out if you hit a wolf; otherwise stay quiet. Right now I\u2019m leaning Ronald or Nicholas, but I\u2019ll adjust after hearing everyone.\"\n\nTurn #6: Nicholas: said: \"I agree with Kimberly, we need to be vigilant moving forward. I think it's crucial we all share our thoughts. I inspected Ronald last night, and he's a Villager. That said, I do find it suspicious that Kimberly seems to be redirecting discussions toward Ronald. I'm interested to hear more about Justin's takes as well. What do you think, Justin?\"\n\nTurn #7: Joseph: said: \"Wild night. If an attack was prevented, it\u2019s likely the Witch burned the save, so today\u2019s vote matters a lot.\n\nNicholas: bold to out with just a Ronald green. If you\u2019re Seer, thanks, but why claim now\u2014were you under pressure or just anchoring the day? Either way, I\u2019m not voting Ronald today.\n\nKimberly: your push on Ronald/Nicholas came before the claim. Now that Ronald is reportedly green, where do you stand? Who\u2019s your updated top suspect and why?\n\nFor me, best info today comes from the quieter slots. Jessica and Justin, I want concrete reads and a preferred elim. My pool is between you two unless something changes. Justin, especially want your take on Nick\u2019s claim and on Kimberly\u2019s early push.\"\n\nTurn #8: Jessica: said: \"I think we should focus on the quieter players today. Joseph, I agree that our votes must be strategic now that we know Ronald is a Villager. My main concern lies with how quickly Kimberly has zeroed in on Ronald without assessing other players. Justin, since you are also quiet, I'm curious about your reads on all this. Let's not forget the power of the Witch\u2014if they saved Ronald, it could put a target on them next. We should discuss our thoughts openly about who may be the remaining werewolves. My suspicion leans towards Kimberly and possibly Justin as well, depending on their responses.\"\n\nTurn #9: Justin: said: \"\"Thanks for the insights, everyone. I agree with the sentiment that we should be vigilant. Nicholas's claim about Ronald being a Villager is bold, and I appreciate the transparency, but it makes me question Nicholas's motives\u2014did he feel pressure or is he trying to lead us somewhere? As for Kimberly, her early push on Ronald does raise some suspicion as it feels a bit opportunistic. I suspect she may be trying to steer the conversation away from herself. I also acknowledge Jessica's points about the quieter players. For now, I\u2019m leaning towards Kimberly as my top suspect due to her aggressive stance on Ronald and lack of broader assessment. Let's continue to share our thoughts, but I think we should keep a close eye on Kimberly today.\"\"\n[Game] Entering state: Day_vote\n\nTurn #10: Ronald: [action] vote Kimberly\nKimberly: [action] vote Justin\nNicholas: [action] vote Kimberly\nJoseph: [action] vote Kimberly\nJessica: [action] vote Kimberly\nJustin: [action] vote Kimberly\n[Game] Kimberly was voted out!\n[Game] Entering state: Night_werewolf\n\nTurn #11: [Game] Entering state: Night_seer\n\nTurn #12: [Game] Entering state: Night_witch\n\nTurn #13: [Game] Nicholas was killed by werewolves!\n[Game] Entering state: Day_discussion\n\nTurn #14: Ronald: said: \"\"We've had another dramatic night, and now we unfortunately lost Nicholas. He was a strong ally and his read on me was crucial. I still stand by my innocence, so we need to focus our attention. I hope the Seer can share their insights soon and the Witch still has their resources for protection. Looking at today's numbers, we need to consider both Joseph and Jessica, who have remained quiet compared to others. I urge everyone to share their thoughts again. We need to be strategic in our voting today to find the remaining Werewolves.\"\"\n\nTurn #15: Joseph: said: \"RIP Nicholas. The NK was the obvious one on the claim\u2014NAI for today. What does matter is D1 positioning. Ronald was greenchecked; I\u2019m not voting him. My strongest suspect is Jessica. Her D1 hedged hard: agreed broadly about focusing on quiet slots, shaded both Kimberly and Justin without committing, and crucially flagged the Witch (\u201cif they saved Ronald, it could put a target on them next\u201d). That reads like role-fishing/setting up night priorities, which is wolfy right after a prevented kill. Combine that with a very safe vote onto the leading wagon and I see scum equity there. Secondary would be Justin, but Jessica > Justin for me. Justin, Jessica had you as a suspect\u2014do you still townread her? Ronald, you already flagged Jessica; I\u2019m aligned there. Barring a strong defense, I\u2019m prepared to vote Jessica today.\"\n\nTurn #16: Jessica: said: \"\"I understand that my previous statements have raised suspicion, Joseph, but I assure you that my intentions have been to guide our discussions rather than mislead. Let's not forget that I did push for us to investigate the quieter players, which remains crucial now. Losing Nicholas was unfortunate, and it highlights the need for strong communication. I want to clarify that my vote was strategic and aimed at the immediate threat of suspicion on Ronald. I\u2019m here to work with the remaining players to identify the Werewolves. We need to stay united and focused on reasoning rather than personal accusations. I am not a Werewolf, and I urge you all to consider the evidence dispassionately.\"\"\n\nTurn #17: Justin: said: \"\"I appreciate the discussions we\u2019ve had, and I want to address a few things today. First, I resonate with Joseph's sentiments regarding Jessica. Her previous actions seemed opportunistic and have raised my suspicion toward her. The fact that she was quick to target both Kimberly and myself while keeping a safe distance from other players is concerning. I would also like to point out that while it\u2019s easy to follow the obvious narratives, we need to remain vigilant on all fronts as the dynamics shift. With the loss of Nicholas, we are now at a crucial point where every vote matters. I propose we consider Jessica as our leading suspect today, but I\u2019m open to more discussion.
