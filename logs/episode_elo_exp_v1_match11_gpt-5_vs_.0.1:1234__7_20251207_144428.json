WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed.

(2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Jessica, George, Nicole, Emily, Jonathan, Brian, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Emily's) goal: Deceive others, avoid detection, and eliminate villagers.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf.

Jonathan was killed last night, and I want to make sure we all understand what happened. Since we don't know who the werewolves are yet, I think it's important to stay open-minded and focus on gathering information. I don't have any personal suspicions, but I do know that the werewolves likely chose someone who wasn't a seer or witch. We should look for patterns in who might be acting suspiciously during the day. Let's keep the discussion constructive and collaborative!\"\n\nTurn #5: George: said: \"RIP Jonathan. Day 1 gives us little, but the wolves likely picked someone unlikely to be protected\u2014maybe just a safe/analytical target. I want concrete reads before we rush a vote. Jessica, your opener is very cautious\u2014any actual leans? Nicole, Brian, what do you make of the kill and Jessica's tone? Emily feels neutral to me so far. If things stay vague, I'm fine voting among the least helpful, but I'd prefer reasons.\"\n\nTurn #6: Nicole: said: \"I just inspected George last night, and he is a werewolf. I believe this is a key piece of information. Given that the wolves likely targeted someone without strong protection, and George was chosen, it makes sense that he is one of them.
