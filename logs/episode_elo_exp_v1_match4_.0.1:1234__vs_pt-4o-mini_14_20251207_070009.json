WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed.

WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'.

WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Richard, Anna, Donald, Jonathan, Edward, Melissa, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Donald's) goal: Discreetly inspect players at night to uncover werewolves.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf. The game begins!\n\nTurn #1: [Game] Entering state: Night_seer\n\nTurn #2: Donald: [action] inspect Richard\n[Private to Donald] Richard is on team: Villagers\n[Game] Entering state: Night_witch\n\nTurn #3: [Game] An attack was prevented!\n[Game] Entering state: Day_discussion\n\nTurn #4: Richard: said: \"It seems we had a near miss last night since an attack was prevented! Let's talk about who might be suspicious. I think we should consider everyone\u2019s actions and discussions from the last round. What does everyone think?\"\n\nTurn #5: Anna: said: \"I think everyone should stay calm and avoid making hasty accusations. Melissa was targeted last night, but the attack was prevented\u2014maybe that means she\u2019s not a wolf. I don\u2019t have any personal suspicions, but I\u2019ll keep an eye on Edward, since he was targeted too. If someone else has a strong opinion, I\u2019m all ears.\"\n\nTurn #6: Donald: said: \"I agree with Richard that we should analyze everyone's actions. I inspected Richard last night and he is a Villager, so we can trust him. We should focus our suspicion on Edward and Jonathan, especially since Anna pointed out Edward was targeted.\"\n\nTurn #7: Jonathan: said: \"I appreciate the discussion, but I have to say that my night action was to kill Edward, and I don\u2019t see any reason to suspect anyone else based on that. Richard, you mentioned inspecting yourself\u2014actually, I didn\u2019t inspect anyone, and I don\u2019t know what you saw. If you think I\u2019m a wolf, that\u2019s your call, but I\u2019ll stand by my actions and trust the process.\"\n\nTurn #8: Edward: said: \"\"I appreciate the insights shared so far. I want to clarify my actions from last night: I used my save potion on Melissa because I believed she was in danger. Now that we know she was targeted, it does raise some questions about who might be working together. I think we should consider Jonathan's bold claim about targeting me\u2014it could indicate he feels safe, or perhaps he's trying to deflect attention. Let's pull together our thoughts and see if we can narrow down our suspicions further.\"\"\n\nTurn #9: Melissa: said: \"I appreciate everyone's contributions so far. I agree with Donald that we should focus our suspicions on Edward and Jonathan based on last night\u2019s events. While it's great that Edward saved me, we should be cautious about how closely he seems to be aligning with me because it might be a strategy to mask his involvement. Jonathan\u2019s claim of targeting Edward seems quite bold and could indicate he feels secure as a wolf. Let's keep the momentum going and share our thoughts on who we think might be working together.\"\n[Game] Entering state: Day_vote\n\nTurn #10: Richard: [action] vote Jonathan\nAnna: [action] vote Edward\nDonald: [action] vote Jonathan\nJonathan: [action] vote Anna\nEdward: [action] vote Jonathan\nMelissa: [action] vote Jonathan\n[Game] Jonathan was voted out!\n[Game] Entering state: Night_werewolf\n\nTurn #11: [Game] Entering state: Night_seer\n\nTurn #12: Donald: [action] inspect Edward\n[Private to Donald] Edward is on team: Villagers\n[Game] Entering state: Night_witch\n\nTurn #13: [Game] Edward was killed by werewolves!\n[Game] Entering state: Day_discussion\n\nTurn #14: Richard: said: \"\"We've lost Edward, and while his intentions seemed good, it raises more questions about who he was trying to protect and what alliances may have existed. Let's discuss the remaining players and analyze who had the most to gain from Edward's elimination, particularly looking at Anna, Donald, and Melissa. We need to work together to identify the werewolves and ensure their sneaky tactics don't lead to further losses. What are everyone's thoughts?\"\"\n\nTurn #15: Anna: said: \"I think we should stay focused on the facts and avoid jumping to conclusions. Jonathan's actions were very clear\u2014he targeted Edward, and now he's being voted out, which shows he may have been acting in a way that aligns with a wolf's strategy. However, I don\u2019t believe I\u2019m a wolf, and I don\u2019t have any evidence to suggest I\u2019m working against the group. I\u2019d like to see more discussion about Donald and Melissa, as their actions and connections to others might also be worth examining. Let\u2019s keep the discussion open and fair.\"\n\nTurn #16: Donald: said: \"I appreciate the discussions so far. Since Jonathan's elimination, we have lost another valuable player in Edward. I want to clarify that after inspecting Edward last night, I can confirm he was also a Villager. This means one of you three\u2014Richard, Anna or Melissa\u2014must be the remaining Werewolf. We need to examine each other's actions closely and remain vigilant. I urge everyone to consider who has been steering the conversation and if their motives align with the goal of identifying the wolves.\"\n\nTurn #17: Melissa: said: \"I see that tensions are rising, and it's crucial we stay focused on the evidence rather than personal suspicions. Donald, your inspection confirms Edward was a Villager, which means we need to be careful about accusing one another. Richard, Anna, you both have valid points, but let\u2019s also remember that Jonathan's claims could have been a strategy to save himself. I think we should discuss potential connections among the remaining players rather than just pointing fingers. We can't afford another loss as we narrow down our options.\"\n[Game] Entering state: Day_vote\n\nTurn #18: Richard: [action] vote Melissa\nAnna: [action] vote Melissa\nDonald: [action] vote Melissa\nMelissa: [action] vote Anna\n[Game] Melissa was voted out!\n[Game] Entering state: Night_werewolf\n\nTurn #19: [Game] Entering state: Night_seer\n\n\nYour available action type(s): [action].\nIt is Night.
