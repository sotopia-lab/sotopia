GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed.

Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Amy, Jessica, Michelle, Timothy, Edward, Kathleen, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Timothy's) goal: Deceive others, avoid detection, and eliminate villagers.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf. The game begins!\nJessica: [action] kill Kathleen\n\nTurn #1: Timothy: [action] kill Edward\n[Game] Entering state: Night_seer\n\nTurn #2: [Game] Entering state: Night_witch\n\nTurn #3: [Game] Edward was killed by werewolves!\n[Game] Entering state: Day_discussion\n\nTurn #4: Amy: said: \"We lost Edward during the night, which is unfortunate. We need to be careful in our discussion today. I want to hear everyone's thoughts on who they suspect may be a werewolf. Let's analyze any behavior or statements from last night that might give us clues.\"\n\nTurn #5: Jessica: said: \"I'm really shaken by Edward's death. I didn't see that coming at all. From my perspective, we might want to consider who was quick to place blame last time as potential suspects. Sometimes those who are most eager to point fingers are attempting to divert attention from themselves. Let's make sure to observe everyone's responses carefully this round.\"\n\nTurn #6: Michelle: said: \"I agree with Amy and Jessica that we need to analyze the behavior of everyone closely. From what I've observed, Jessica's point about those who are eager to blame others is interesting. We should also think back to who was quiet during the last round; they could be hiding something. Let's focus on those behaviors to identify any werewolves.\"\n\nTurn #7: Timothy: said: \"I feel the same sense of loss with Edward's passing, but I can't help but wonder if this is an attempt to target someone quiet and unsuspecting. Amy, you've been guiding a lot of the discussions, but maybe that's just what we need. I think sticking together as a village is crucial. Let's be careful about who we trust too quickly. Perhaps we should keep a close eye on behavior changes or sudden alliances; these might be clues leading us to the real werewolves.\"\n\nTurn #8: Kathleen: said: \"\"I appreciate everyone's input so far. It\u2019s a good strategy to examine behavior closely. I'd like to draw attention to the discussions from last night. Remember, there were some players who seemed particularly quiet or hesitant to engage. While Jason and Timothy are being vocal, we should not forget the ones who didn\u2019t speak much. I'd like us to consider those who haven't contributed as much. It's possible they are trying to avoid drawing attention to themselves. Let's ensure we look at the overall pattern of interactions, not just the obvious blamers.\"\"\n[Game] Entering state: Day_vote\n\nTurn #9: Amy: [action] vote Jessica\nJessica: [action] vote Kathleen\nMichelle: [action] vote Jessica\nTimothy: [action] vote Kathleen\nKathleen: [action] vote Jessica\n[Game] Jessica was voted out!\n[Game] Entering state: Night_werewolf\n\nTurn #10: Timothy: [action] kill Kathleen\n[Game] Entering state: Night_seer\n\nTurn #11: [Game] Entering state: Night_witch\n\nTurn #12: [Game] Kathleen was killed by werewolves!\n[Game] Entering state: Day_discussion\n\nTurn #13: Amy: said: \"\"We've lost Kathleen too, which is devastating. That means we are down to just four players. We need to be extremely careful with our discussions and votes today. Last night, Jessica was executed, and now Kathleen is gone. This raises the stakes significantly. I want to hear from Michelle and Timothy about who they suspect might be a werewolf now that we're fewer in number. Let\u2019s ensure we make a decision based on logic rather than emotions, as we could be very close to uncovering the werewolves.\"\"\n\nTurn #14: Michelle: said: \"I agree with Amy, and I'm very concerned about how quickly we've lost both Jessica and Kathleen. This leaves us in a precarious position, and I want us to analyze our discussions. I know from my inspections that we have werewolves among us. Unfortunately, I discovered that both Jessica and Timothy are on the werewolf team. We need to focus on who among us might be misleading us during these conversations. I suspect Timothy, especially since he directed attention towards Amy. Let\u2019s discuss our next steps carefully.\"\n\nTurn #15: Timothy: said: \"\"This is a serious allegation, Michelle, and I'm surprised you'd aim it at me. Considering how quickly the village has been decreasing, I understand why we're all on edge. But let's think rationally. My intention has always been to protect and unite us. As you know, anyone could adopt the guise of a villager and point fingers to deflect suspicion. While I was skeptic of Amy earlier, it was merely a precaution to urge everyone to observe changes in behavior. Let's focus on any inconsistencies or abrupt changes in claims between the votes and now, instead of rushing to decisions. We need to ensure survival by targeting real threats, not each other out of panic.\"\"\n[Game] Entering state: Day_vote\n\n\nYour available action type(s): [action].\nIt is voting time.
