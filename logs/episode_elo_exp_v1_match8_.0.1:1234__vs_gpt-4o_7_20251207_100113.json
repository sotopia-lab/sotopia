WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Laura, Jonathan, Thomas, Richard, Michelle, Sarah, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Thomas's) goal: Discreetly inspect players at night to uncover werewolves.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf.

(4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Laura, Jonathan, Thomas, Richard, Michelle, Sarah, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Jonathan's) goal: Deceive others, avoid detection, and eliminate villagers.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf.

It looks like nobody died last night, which is great news for us villagers! It means someone likely made a heroic save or the werewolves were weakened in their attack. It's vital we share any insights and suspicions today, especially since the seer and witch have crucial intel. Jonathan, do you have any thoughts on what might have happened or on who seems suspicious? Let's try to piece together what's going on.\"\n\nTurn #5: Jonathan: said: \"Good morning, Laura. I'm glad no one died, but I have to be honest\u2014I'm a bit suspicious of Richard. He just attacked Michelle, and I don't see why he'd target her unless he had a personal reason. Also, Michelle is someone I trust, so if she was targeted, it might mean someone else is hiding something. I'm not saying Richard is a wolf, but he seems out of place. Let's keep watching him closely.\"\n\nTurn #6: Thomas: said: \"Hello everyone. I'm relieved no one was lost last night, which gives us a better chance to win this. I think it's important to focus on gathering more information and hashing out our suspicions, like Laura suggested. From my perspective, Jonathan's quick leap to suspect Richard catches my attention. We need to be careful and not jump to conclusions without proper evidence. I'd like to know more about why Richard, in particular, stood out to Jonathan. Is there anything specific from last night that supports this suspicion?\"\n\nTurn #7: Richard: said: \"Good morning, everyone. I appreciate the discussion, but I have to clarify that I didn't kill Michelle\u2014there's a mistake in the records. I actually didn't act at all last night. I'm just a regular player trying to stay out of the spotlight. If anyone has concerns, I'd be happy to help clarify or share more about my role. Let's keep the focus on solid facts and not let assumptions drive our decisions.\"\n\nTurn #8: Michelle: said: \"Good morning, everyone. I want to clarify something important: I was targeted last night, and I took action to save myself. That's why we all made it through safely. I'm grateful for the opportunity to discuss potential threats this morning. Now, I want to emphasize something crucial: we need to be careful with our suspicions, and ensuring solid evidence is key to our success. While I appreciate Jonathan's instinct to protect me, I urge everyone to consider the facts over assumptions. Laura is right about strategic discourse \u2014 all opinions are valuable. We must work together to uncover the truth and support our villagers. Together, we can identify the real threat among us.\"\n\nTurn #9: Sarah: said: \"Good morning, everyone. I'm thankful we're all here to have this discussion today. Michelle's bravery in revealing her targeted attack is crucial information for us. It hints that the werewolves were indeed active, but fortunately, thwarted. Given the suspicions around both Richard and Jonathan, here's my thought: wouldn't it be prudent if our Seer checks one of them tonight? This way, we can rely on some solid evidence to help guide us.
