GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Steven, William, James, Laura, Stephen, Sharon, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (James's) goal: Discreetly inspect players at night to uncover werewolves.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf.

It's crucial that we continue to share our observations and instincts, as we did this morning. I find it strange that there was an attempt on someone's life but no one was lost, leading me to believe that a life was indeed saved, and perhaps not by coincidence. I think we should keep all possibilities on the table, and consider why the supposed attempt couldn't succeed. Could it be the work of a cunning werewolf trying to manipulate us, or simply a mistake in guessing someone's role? Let's listen carefully to what everyone has to say today and remain alert to any suspicious behavior. Remember, the werewolves are among us, trying to blend in and cause discord among the villagers. Together, I believe we can outsmart them.\"\"\n\nTurn #9: Sharon: said: \"\"It's great to hear from everyone this morning. We're in a fortunate position since no one was lost, which suggests someone acted last night to save a life. I understand Laura's uncertainty about why she might have been targeted, but given the current tension, every piece of information helps us. We need to be attentive to our instincts and listen carefully to each person today. Werewolves often rely on creating doubt and confusion, so clarity in our communication is key.

Let's work together to keep our village safe.\"\n\nTurn #5: William: said: \"\"I agree with Steven. Last night was interesting, and it's vital we all share our observations. I think it's strange that Laura seemed to be a target last night. It raises some questions about who might have wanted to eliminate her. I suspect that maybe she wasn't innocent after all, but we need to be cautious in our accusations.\"\"\n\nTurn #6: James: said: \"\"Good morning, everyone. Last night, my instincts told me to focus on Steven, and I discovered that he's definitely on our side among the villagers. I agree with the cautious approach we've taken so far; no one was lost last night, which is a relief. However, William's point about Laura being a target is interesting. Laura, do you feel like sharing why you might have been targeted? It's possible someone is trying to stir confusion. Let's try to piece these hints together without jumping to conclusions too early.\"\"\n\nTurn #7: Laura: said: \"\"Good morning everyone. I appreciate the concern, but I assure you, I have no idea why I was targeted. Maybe the werewolves wanted to eliminate someone they found suspicious or perhaps to create confusion among us \u2013 it's so easy to point fingers when there's no clear evidence. I'm just a villager trying to figure this out with all of you. Let's focus on gathering clues together and watch how everyone behaves today. It could tell us more about who might be hiding something.\"\"\n\nTurn #8: Stephen: said: \"\"Good morning, everyone. I'm glad we managed to get through the night without any losses. It's crucial that we continue to share our observations and instincts, as we did this morning. I find it strange that there was an attempt on someone's life but no one was lost, leading me to believe that a life was indeed saved, and perhaps not by coincidence. I think we should keep all possibilities on the table, and consider why the supposed attempt couldn't succeed. Could it be the work of a cunning werewolf trying to manipulate us, or simply a mistake in guessing someone's role? Let's listen carefully to what everyone has to say today and remain alert to any suspicious behavior. Remember, the werewolves are among us, trying to blend in and cause discord among the villagers. Together, I believe we can outsmart them.\"\"\n\nTurn #9: Sharon: said: \"\"It's great to hear from everyone this morning. We're in a fortunate position since no one was lost, which suggests someone acted last night to save a life. I understand Laura's uncertainty about why she might have been targeted, but given the current tension, every piece of information helps us. We need to be attentive to our instincts and listen carefully to each person today. Werewolves often rely on creating doubt and confusion, so clarity in our communication is key.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public.
