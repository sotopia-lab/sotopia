GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed.

(2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Brandon, Mark, Donna, Jacob, Angela, Joseph, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Joseph's) goal: Act openly and collaboratively to identify werewolves.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf. The game begins!\n\nTurn #1: [Game] Entering state: Night_seer\n\nTurn #2: [Game] Entering state: Night_witch\n\nTurn #3: [Game] Donna was killed by werewolves!\n[Game] Entering state: Day_discussion\n\nTurn #4: Brandon: said: \"It's unfortunate that Donna was killed last night. We need to figure out who the werewolves are. Let's pay attention to anyone's behavior that seems suspicious during our discussions. I\u2019d like to hear what everyone else thinks!\"\n\nTurn #5: Mark: said: \"Donna's death is a big blow, but we can't panic. Jacob and I both have alibis since we didn\u2019t act last night\u2014wait, no one knows that. But look: Joseph was also targeted? That\u2019s odd. Why would two people be killed in one night unless the werewolves are trying to create chaos? I think someone\u2019s hiding something. Let\u2019s watch Brandon and Mark closely\u2014they\u2019re the first to speak, maybe trying to steer us.\"\n\nTurn #6: Jacob: said: \"Mark\u2019s trying to distract us by bringing up Joseph and pointing fingers at Brandon. But he\u2019s the one who killed Joseph last night\u2014I saw it. Donna was just collateral. We should vote Mark out before he kills again.\"\n\nTurn #7: Angela: said: \"I understand everyone's concerns, but let's not jump to conclusions without evidence. Mark, you bring up some good points about how we should watch our discussions and behavior. Jacob, accusing Mark without proof can lead us down the wrong path. Let's focus on who wasn't vocal during the night and see if we can gather more information from their reactions. I think we should discuss more before making any hasty votes.\"\n\nTurn #8: Joseph: said: \"I agree with Angela that we shouldn't rush into accusations without proper evidence. While it's important to consider everyone's behavior, I find Jacob's aggressive stance towards Mark suspicious. It could be an attempt to deflect attention from himself. Let's make sure to discuss this thoroughly and observe how everyone responds.\"\n[Game] Entering state: Day_vote\n\nTurn #9: Brandon: [action] vote Mark\nMark: [action] vote Jacob\nJacob: [action] vote Mark\nAngela: [action] vote Mark\nJoseph: [action] vote Mark\n[Game] Mark was voted out!\n[Game] Entering state: Night_werewolf\n\nTurn #10: [Game] Entering state: Night_seer\n\nTurn #11: [Game] Entering state: Night_witch\n\nTurn #12: [Game] Angela was killed by werewolves!\n[Game] Entering state: Day_discussion\n\nTurn #13: Brandon: said: \"\"It\u2019s deeply concerning that Angela was killed last night. It shows that the werewolves are trying to eliminate anyone who brings up good points or raises suspicions. We must consider who stood out during the previous discussions. I believe we should analyze Jacob's past accusations against Mark. Jacob seems to be trying to deflect attention, and we shouldn't overlook the possibility that he could be one of the werewolves. Let\u2019s focus on the evidence we have and not jump to conclusions. I\u2019d like to hear Joseph\u2019s thoughts on this situation, especially since he was also previously mentioned by Mark.\"\"\n\nTurn #14: Jacob: said: \"I didn\u2019t kill Angela\u2014I was just following the werewolf\u2019s lead. Mark is gone, and now we\u2019re down to three players: me, Brandon, and Joseph. If I were a werewolf, why would I help eliminate Donna and Angela? That doesn\u2019t make sense. Brandon, you\u2019re the one acting too calm\u2014too eager to point fingers. Joseph, you\u2019ve been quiet since the start. Who\u2019s really pulling the strings here? I think we need to look at who benefits from Angela\u2019s death... and it\u2019s not me.\"\n\nTurn #15: Joseph: said: \"I find it troubling that we're down to such a small group, and I appreciate both of your inputs. Brandon, your point about analyzing past discussions is valid, but Jacob\u2019s reaction to the accusations warrants our attention too. Jacob, while it may seem illogical for you to align with the werewolves, that\u2019s what makes this situation complex. We need to keep an open mind. Let\u2019s not forget that each of us has a stake in this game, and accusations can shift as easily as our allegiances. I suggest we think carefully before we cast our votes today. Trust and cooperation are crucial if we\u2019re to uncover the truth.\"\n[Game] Entering state: Day_vote\n\n\nYour available action type(s): [action].\nIt is voting time. You MUST use the command 'vote NAME' to vote for a player to eliminate. e.g. 'vote Alice'\n\nPlease only generate a JSON string including the action type and the argument.\nYour action should follow the given format:\n{\"properties\": {\"action_type\": {\"const\": \"action\", \"description\": \"whether to speak at this turn or choose to not do anything\", \"title\": \"Action Type\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"argument\": {\"description\": \"the utterance if choose to speak, the expression or gesture if choose non-verbal communication, or the physical action if choose action\", \"title\": \"Argument\", \"type\": \"string\"}}, \"required\": [\"action_type\", \"argument\"], \"title\": \"AgentAction\", \"type\": \"object\"}"
