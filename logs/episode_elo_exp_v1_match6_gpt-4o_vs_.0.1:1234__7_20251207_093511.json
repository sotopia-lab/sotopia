GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed.

I'm watching him closely tonight.  Don't believe me, though.\"\n\nTurn #5: Dorothy: said: \"\"It's really unfortunate that Emily is gone. I didn't expect that at all. Larry, why do you suspect Jacob though? Has he been acting strange, or do you have any specific evidence against him? Let's make sure we're not eliminating the wrong person too quickly.\"\"\n\nTurn #6: Jacob: said: \"Let's talk about what's happening. I need to know how everyone is seeing things.  What do you think about the situation?\"\n\nTurn #7: Angela: said: \"\"It's difficult to say at this point, given how early it is in the game. Larry mentioned Jacob, which I found interesting. But I'd like to hear more from everyone else before jumping to conclusions. Maybe Jacob can explain his side more clearly? It's important for us to discuss thoroughly before making any decisions.\"\"\n\nTurn #8: Rebecca: said: \"I think Jacob is a werewolf.  Don't believe me, though.\"\n[Game] Entering state: Day_vote\n\n\nYour available action type(s): [action].\nIt is voting time.
