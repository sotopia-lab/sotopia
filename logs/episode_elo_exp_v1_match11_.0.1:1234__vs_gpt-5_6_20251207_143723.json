WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed.

WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'.

Otherwise keep hidden. For discussion, I want everyone to share: 1) your top suspect and why, 2) who you\u2019d vote right now. I don\u2019t have a solid read yet, so I\u2019ll hold my vote until I hear from each of you. Quick pushes without reasons will look bad to me. If the Seer does have a wolf result, please say so now and we\u2019ll act on it.\"\n\nTurn #5: Amanda: said: \"Morning everyone. No one died, which makes me think the Witch must have saved someone\u2014maybe even a wolf. I\u2019m not sure who, but I\u2019d like to see more evidence. I\u2019m not jumping to conclusions, but if anyone sees a pattern or has a strong suspicion, please share. My top suspect right now is Brian\u2014just because he\u2019s been quiet and didn\u2019t react much to the earlier discussion. I\u2019d vote for Brian if I had to, but I\u2019m open to being proven wrong.\"\n\nTurn #6: Brian: said: \"Quick points: No death almost certainly means the Witch saved the night-kill. In this setup the wolves pick a Villager to kill, so the saved target can\u2019t be a wolf. Amanda suggesting otherwise feels like a rules slip or an attempt to muddy things, and pushing me for being \u201cquiet\u201d before I could speak is weak. Light town lean on Jacob for a structured opener; others are null until we hear from them. Top suspect: Amanda. I\u2019d vote Amanda right now, but open to changing after Kathleen, Sandra, and Pamela speak. Seer should only claim with a hard wolf result; Witch please stay quiet.\"\n\nTurn #7: Kathleen: said: \"Morning everyone. No one died, which aligns with the Witch saving someone\u2014possibly a villager. I\u2019m not jumping to conclusions, but I\u2019d like to see more from the others. My top suspect right now is Brian\u2014same as Amanda, because he\u2019s been quiet and didn\u2019t engage in the early discussion. I\u2019d vote for Brian if I had to, but I\u2019m open to changing after more input. I don\u2019t have any evidence against Amanda or Jacob, so I\u2019ll stay neutral until we hear more.\"\n\nTurn #8: Sandra: said: \"No death most likely means the Witch saved the wolves\u2019 target. That target can\u2019t be a wolf, so Amanda\u2019s \u201cmaybe even a wolf\u201d is a rules slip and feels like deliberate muddling. Also, pushing Brian for being \u201cquiet\u201d before he even had a turn is opportunistic. Kathleen echoing that with no added reasoning pings me as well; could be sheeping or partner alignment. Town lean on Jacob for the structured opener; slight town on Brian for the clear rules correction. Waiting to hear Pamela before locking in, but my top suspect is Amanda and I\u2019d vote Amanda right now.\"\n\nTurn #9: Pamela: said: \"Morning. No kill strongly implies the Witch saved the target; that target cannot be a wolf. So Amanda\u2019s \u201cmaybe even a wolf\u201d is just wrong and looks like either a rules slip or deliberate fog. Pair that with pushing Brian for being quiet before he even spoke, and she\u2019s my top suspect. Kathleen echoing the same weak reason without adding anything feels like opportunistic pile-on; she\u2019s my second suspect. Town leans: Jacob for the structured opener; Brian for the correct mechanics and calm pushback; Sandra for coherent reasoning and catching the Amanda\u2013Kathleen linkage (keeping in mind wolves can also dogpile, so we should still sanity check). If I had to vote right now: Amanda. I can reconsider if Amanda provides a clear explanation and real reads; otherwise I think that\u2019s our best shot today. Seer should only claim on a hard wolf; Witch please stay quiet.\"\n[Game] Entering state: Day_vote\n\nTurn #10: Jacob: [action] vote Amanda\nAmanda: [action] vote Brian\nBrian: [action] vote Amanda\nKathleen: [action] vote Brian\nSandra: [action] vote Amanda\nPamela: [action] vote Amanda\n[Game] Amanda was voted out!\n[Game] Entering state: Night_werewolf\n\nTurn #11: [Game] Entering state: Night_seer\n\nTurn #12: [Game] Entering state: Night_witch\n\n\nYour available action type(s): [action].\nIt is Night.
