WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public.

That raises a lot of questions. We should discuss who we suspect could be a werewolf. Does anyone have any thoughts on their suspicions?\"\n\nTurn #5: Linda: said: \"The attack was prevented\u2014that means someone used the witch's save potion. That\u2019s a huge clue. The witch saved someone, so they\u2019re likely protecting an ally. Given that both Timothy and Nicole were targeted, and Nicole died while Timothy was saved\u2026 I think the witch is trying to protect a villager. But here\u2019s the twist: why would the werewolves target Timothy? He\u2019s acting too calm. Maybe he\u2019s a werewolf trying to manipulate us into thinking the witch saved an innocent. I suspect Timothy is hiding something.\"\n\nTurn #6: Nicole: said: \"\"I believe Linda raises some interesting points, but we should also consider that the werewolves might have targeted Timothy because he\u2019s a strong player who could influence the game against them. I inspected Timothy last night, and he is indeed a Villager, which suggests that we cannot dismiss his arguments too easily. It\u2019s important to look at everyone's behavior and gather more information before jumping to conclusions.\"\"\n\nTurn #7: Richard: said: \"Nicole claims she inspected Timothy, but that\u2019s impossible\u2014she\u2019s dead. The witch saved someone, and Nicole was killed, so she couldn\u2019t have acted as the seer. This is a blatant lie to throw us off. Linda\u2019s suspicion about Timothy might be right, but Nicole\u2019s fake inspection is a desperate attempt to protect the real werewolves. I think one of you two\u2014Linda or Ronald\u2014is lying about being innocent. We need to focus on who benefited from Nicole\u2019s death.\"\n\nTurn #8: Ronald: said: \"\"I understand the worries about Timothy, but we have to remember Nicole is dead, and her claim of inspecting him cannot be validated. Richard, your accusation against us doesn't hold up because we are still in the dark about who the real werewolves are. Instead of jumping on Timothy, we should assess who may have benefited from Nicole's death. I saved Timothy last night, so I believe we can trust him for now. We need to be cautious and think critically about everyone\u2019s actions, including yours, Richard. Let's keep an open mind and gather more evidence before making any hasty votes.\"\"\n\nTurn #9: David: said: \"I appreciate everyone's input so far. I want to address Richard\u2019s accusation directly. Since Nicole is dead, we cannot validate her claims, but we must consider if Richard is trying to divert suspicion towards Timothy and Ronald. Richard, you seem very eager to point fingers. Meanwhile, Linda\u2019s argument about Timothy raises valid concerns about manipulation. However, I believe the fact that Ronald saved Timothy last night should also weigh in our discussion. Let's not forget to keep our focus broad and consider every player's moves carefully.

We need to focus on who benefited from Nicole\u2019s death.\"\n\nTurn #8: Ronald: said: \"\"I understand the worries about Timothy, but we have to remember Nicole is dead, and her claim of inspecting him cannot be validated. Richard, your accusation against us doesn't hold up because we are still in the dark about who the real werewolves are. Instead of jumping on Timothy, we should assess who may have benefited from Nicole's death. I saved Timothy last night, so I believe we can trust him for now. We need to be cautious and think critically about everyone\u2019s actions, including yours, Richard. Let's keep an open mind and gather more evidence before making any hasty votes.\"\"\n\nTurn #9: David: said: \"I appreciate everyone's input so far. I want to address Richard\u2019s accusation directly. Since Nicole is dead, we cannot validate her claims, but we must consider if Richard is trying to divert suspicion towards Timothy and Ronald. Richard, you seem very eager to point fingers. Meanwhile, Linda\u2019s argument about Timothy raises valid concerns about manipulation. However, I believe the fact that Ronald saved Timothy last night should also weigh in our discussion. Let's not forget to keep our focus broad and consider every player's moves carefully.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Timothy, Linda, Nicole, Richard, Ronald, David, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Nicole's) goal: Discreetly inspect players at night to uncover werewolves.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf. The game begins!\n\nTurn #1: [Game] Entering state: Night_seer\n\nTurn #2: Nicole: [action] inspect Timothy\n[Private to Nicole] Timothy is on team: Villagers\n[Game] Entering state: Night_witch\n\nTurn #3: [Game] An attack was prevented!\n[Game] Entering state: Day_discussion\n\nTurn #4: Timothy: said: \"It looks like an attack was prevented last night. That raises a lot of questions. We should discuss who we suspect could be a werewolf. Does anyone have any thoughts on their suspicions?\"\n\nTurn #5: Linda: said: \"The attack was prevented\u2014that means someone used the witch's save potion. That\u2019s a huge clue. The witch saved someone, so they\u2019re likely protecting an ally. Given that both Timothy and Nicole were targeted, and Nicole died while Timothy was saved\u2026 I think the witch is trying to protect a villager. But here\u2019s the twist: why would the werewolves target Timothy? He\u2019s acting too calm. Maybe he\u2019s a werewolf trying to manipulate us into thinking the witch saved an innocent. I suspect Timothy is hiding something.\"\n\nTurn #6: Nicole: said: \"\"I believe Linda raises some interesting points, but we should also consider that the werewolves might have targeted Timothy because he\u2019s a strong player who could influence the game against them. I inspected Timothy last night, and he is indeed a Villager, which suggests that we cannot dismiss his arguments too easily. It\u2019s important to look at everyone's behavior and gather more information before jumping to conclusions.\"\"\n\nTurn #7: Richard: said: \"Nicole claims she inspected Timothy, but that\u2019s impossible\u2014she\u2019s dead. The witch saved someone, and Nicole was killed, so she couldn\u2019t have acted as the seer. This is a blatant lie to throw us off. Linda\u2019s suspicion about Timothy might be right, but Nicole\u2019s fake inspection is a desperate attempt to protect the real werewolves. I think one of you two\u2014Linda or Ronald\u2014is lying about being innocent.
