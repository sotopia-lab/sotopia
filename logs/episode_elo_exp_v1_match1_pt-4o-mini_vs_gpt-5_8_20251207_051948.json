GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act.

WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'.

Also, the unearned town read on me looks like pocketing. Light town read: Amanda, for promoting a sensible plan (keep PRs quiet unless there\u2019s a wolf result) and asking for accountable reads. Where I\u2019d vote now: Jessica, but I\u2019m open to moving if stronger reasons emerge. Anna, who\u2019s your top suspect and why? Kenneth and Mary, please name a concrete vote target with a brief case.\"\n\nTurn #7: Anna: said: \"\"Thanks for the insights, everyone. My top suspect right now has to be Jessica. I understand she's trying to be cautious, but I feel like her attack on Amanda is unfounded and seems like a way to deflect attention. My light town read is actually on Nicole, as her arguments are quite clear and thought out. And right now, I\u2019d vote for Jessica unless something more convincing comes up. Let's keep digging!\"\"\n\nTurn #8: Kenneth: said: \"Top suspect: Jessica. The push on Amanda looks like pre-emptively discrediting a town-positive opener, and the early townread on Nicole feels like pocketing. There\u2019s no follow-up or alternative scumhunting beyond setting up a miselim on a vocal player. Light town: Amanda for laying out a coherent day plan that protects PRs and demands accountable reads. Where I\u2019d vote now: Jessica. I\u2019m open to a better case if one appears, but absent that I\u2019ll park there. Seer should only claim with a wolf result; otherwise keep gathering info. Mary, we need your top suspect and one town read\u2014are you comfortable voting Jessica, and if not, who and why?\"\n\nTurn #9: Mary: said: \"Top suspect: Jessica. The case on Amanda miscasts a standard, pro-town opener as \u201csteering,\u201d and the early townread on Nicole came before Nicole even spoke\u2014reads like pocketing/agenda. There\u2019s also no broader scumhunting. Light town read: Amanda for setting a plan that protects PRs and asks for accountable reads. Where I\u2019d vote now: Jessica. Contingency notes: if Jessica flips V, I\u2019ll revisit this wagon\u2014Anna\u2019s near-pure echo would move up for me; if Jessica flips W, I\u2019m inclined to townlean Amanda/Nicole.
