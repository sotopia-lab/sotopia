WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone.

Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'.

DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public.

This makes me even more certain that we should focus our discussions on identifying the remaining Werewolves. We need to consider who might have had the motive to target them both. Daniel was voted out last round, but that doesn\u2019t mean he was a Werewolf. We should reflect on how other players have been acting since then and see if there are any patterns in behavior that might point to the Werewolves. Let\u2019s share our thoughts openly and figure out who we can trust moving forward!\"\"\n\nTurn #16: Nicole: said: \"I understand the current situation, and I agree that we need to stay vigilant. The fact that both Margaret and Brian were targeted and eliminated raises concerns about who might still be acting with malicious intent. I don\u2019t see any reason to suspect anyone in particular at this moment, but I will keep a close eye on Daniel's behavior. He was voted out, and while that doesn\u2019t prove anything, it might indicate something. I believe we should focus on consistency in statements and look for any patterns in who has been acting suspiciously over the past few days. Let\u2019s keep the discussion open and fair.\"\n\nTurn #17: Lisa: said: \"\"I share your concerns, Karen and Nicole. The loss of Margaret and Brian definitely puts us at a disadvantage. It's crucial we reassess our discussions and scrutinize everyone's behaviors moving forward. We should specifically examine who was quick to cast suspicion on others and whether their reasoning was sound or not. I think we need to focus on the remaining players and see if there are any patterns or alliances forming that suggest who the Werewolves might be.
