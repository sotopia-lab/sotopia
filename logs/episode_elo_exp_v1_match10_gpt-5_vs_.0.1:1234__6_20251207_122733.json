NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager.

WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Thomas, Emma, James, Kimberly, Michael, Mary, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Mary's) goal: Act openly and collaboratively to identify werewolves.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf.

I'm Thomas. I heard the attack was prevented\u2014this means the Witch used her save potion. That\u2019s a big clue: someone was targeted, and the Witch acted to save them. We should focus on who might have been in danger last night. Since the Witch saved someone, it\u2019s likely they were either a key target like the Seer or a Villager the Werewolves wanted gone. Let\u2019s listen carefully to everyone\u2019s statements today\u2014especially who seems nervous or overly defensive. I\u2019m open to suggestions, but let\u2019s start by asking Emma what she thinks.\"\n\nTurn #5: Emma: said: \"Thanks, Thomas. The only hard info is that the Witch used their save. Witch should stay quiet and Seer stay hidden. Speculating about who was targeted is mostly noise\u2014only the Witch knows, and wolves already know who they hit. Let\u2019s judge people on how they push today. I want clear stances: James, who would you vote right now and why? Michael, give your top two suspects with one sentence each.

Since I inspected Thomas last night and confirmed he\u2019s a Villager, his claim about the Witch\u2019s action makes sense, but doesn\u2019t point to anyone specific. I\u2019m not ready to vote yet\u2014too little info. But I agree with you: we need clear stances. Michael, your turn. And Mary\u2014I think voting a quiet player can be dangerous if they\u2019re innocent; better to challenge the early leader, like Thomas, who\u2019s already steering the conversation.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Thomas, Emma, James, Kimberly, Michael, Mary, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Kimberly's) goal: Deceive others, avoid detection, and eliminate villagers.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf.

I'm Thomas. I heard the attack was prevented\u2014this means the Witch used her save potion. That\u2019s a big clue: someone was targeted, and the Witch acted to save them. We should focus on who might have been in danger last night. Since the Witch saved someone, it\u2019s likely they were either a key target like the Seer or a Villager the Werewolves wanted gone. Let\u2019s listen carefully to everyone\u2019s statements today\u2014especially who seems nervous or overly defensive. I\u2019m open to suggestions, but let\u2019s start by asking Emma what she thinks.\"\n\nTurn #5: Emma: said: \"Thanks, Thomas. The only hard info is that the Witch used their save. Witch should stay quiet and Seer stay hidden. Speculating about who was targeted is mostly noise\u2014only the Witch knows, and wolves already know who they hit. Let\u2019s judge people on how they push today. I want clear stances: James, who would you vote right now and why? Michael, give your top two suspects with one sentence each. Mary, between voting a quiet player or an early leader today, which is better and why? If I had to vote this second, I\u2019d pressure James until he commits to a read.\"\n\nTurn #6: James: said: \"Thanks, Emma. I appreciate the push. Based on what we know: the Witch saved someone, and the Werewolves targeted that person\u2014likely someone they saw as a threat. Since I inspected Thomas last night and confirmed he\u2019s a Villager, his claim about the Witch\u2019s action makes sense, but doesn\u2019t point to anyone specific. I\u2019m not ready to vote yet\u2014too little info. But I agree with you: we need clear stances. Michael, your turn. And Mary\u2014I think voting a quiet player can be dangerous if they\u2019re innocent; better to challenge the early leader, like Thomas, who\u2019s already steering the conversation. Let\u2019s see if others are as confident as he is.\"\n\nTurn #7: Kimberly: said: \"Quick thoughts: Speculating on who was saved is noise; focus on pushes and votes. James, you basically outed a check on Thomas\u2014why reveal that now, and why pick Thomas? If you\u2019re real, this paints a target on you; if not, it\u2019s a convenient fake-clear. I don\u2019t want us to anchor on a single claim. Early leans: Emma feels proactively solvy (light town), Thomas null pending more, James slight scumlean for premature claim. Michael and Mary, give a vote right now with a short reason and a backup suspect. If I had to vote this second, I\u2019d pressure James, but I\u2019m open to moving based on Michael/Mary\u2019s takes.\"\n\nTurn #8: Michael: said: \"I saved Thomas last night because I sensed danger around him\u2014he was the first to speak at dawn and seemed overly eager to steer the narrative. That\u2019s not necessarily suspicious, but in a game where everyone claims innocence, the person who pushes hardest often has something to hide. James says he checked Thomas\u2014why reveal that now? It\u2019s too convenient. I\u2019m not convinced Thomas is the target; maybe James is trying to misdirect. My top suspect is James: he\u2019s offering a \u2018check\u2019 without being the Seer, and he\u2019s pushing Thomas as the focus. My backup suspect is Emma\u2014she\u2019s pressuring everyone to vote early, which feels like a wolf trying to rush the game. I\u2019m not voting yet, but if we don\u2019t get clearer info, I\u2019ll vote James next round.\"\n\nTurn #9: Mary: said: \"Thanks, Michael and Kimberly. I\u2019m Mary. I agree that James\u2019s claim of inspecting Thomas is suspicious\u2014it\u2019s too convenient and risks exposing him if he\u2019s a wolf. But I also think Emma is pushing too hard to get votes early, which could be a tactic to cover for werewolves. I\u2019m not convinced Thomas is the target; if anything, the Witch saved someone who wasn\u2019t vocal\u2014maybe me or Kimberly. I\u2019m not voting yet either, but if we don\u2019t get more info, I\u2019ll lean toward James as the top suspect because of his premature claim.

Michael was killed by the Werewolves, and Emma was poisoned by the Witch. That means the Witch used her poison potion, not save, which tells us she acted offensively, likely because she knew Emma was a Werewolf. The Werewolves targeted Michael last night, which means they\u2019re now down to one wolf\u2014and we have three players left: me (Thomas), Kimberly, and Mary. Since the Witch poisoned Emma, she must have been certain of her role\u2014so Emma was likely a Werewolf. That leaves one Werewolf still alive, and it\u2019s probably Kimberly or Mary. I\u2019m not sure who yet, but we need to look at behavior: Kimberly called out James\u2019s fake check earlier and was cautious; Mary echoed that concern. The Werewolf is likely the one who stayed quietest or tried to steer suspicion elsewhere. Kimberly, what did you think of Mary\u2019s reaction when Michael was killed? Mary, do you have a read on Kimberly? Let\u2019s not rush\u2014let\u2019s use logic, not panic.\"\n\nTurn #16: Kimberly: said: \"Thomas, two things up front: (1) Poison doesn\u2019t confirm alignment\u2014Witch can be wrong\u2014so let\u2019s not auto-assume Emma was a wolf. (2) Michael basically soft-claimed Witch with \u201cI saved Thomas,\u201d so the wolf killing him is expected regardless of who it is.\n\nWhy I think Mary is the best vote:\n- Day 1 hedging: She shaded both James and Emma, then chose the safe wagon on James when it was clear. That\u2019s opportunistic distancing from Emma without ever pushing her.\n- Saved-target speculation: \u201cMaybe me or Kimberly\u201d being saved was a weird, self-including guess that only the Witch would truly know\u2014reads like agenda-setting for future miselims.\n- Night logic: If Mary were the last wolf, killing Michael makes perfect sense: remove the claimed Witch (and his poison) and silence someone who had Emma as a backup suspect. Wolves wouldn\u2019t know the Witch would poison Emma that same night.\n\nAnswering your prompt: Mary hasn\u2019t reacted yet today to Michael\u2019s death, but her Day 1 pattern plus that save speculation are still my biggest red flags.\n\nMary, why did you float suspicion on Emma then avoid voting her? And why suggest the save might be on \u201cme or Kimberly\u201d? What made you pick James over Emma at EOD?\n\nI\u2019m prepared to vote Mary here. Thomas, if you\u2019re town, this is the safer, more consistent solve than auto-connecting me to Emma off a poison result.\"\n\nTurn #17: Mary: said: \"Kimberly, I understand your concerns, but let\u2019s not misread my Day 1 statements. I didn\u2019t speculate about the save because I knew anything\u2014I was just pointing out that Thomas and Emma were both vocal, so it made sense the Witch might have saved someone quieter. I didn\u2019t vote Emma because she was being targeted by everyone, and I didn\u2019t want to rush an execution without evidence. Michael claimed to be Witch\u2014that\u2019s a huge risk, and if he was lying, his death is logical. Emma\u2019s poison is suspicious, but not proof she was a wolf. I\u2019m not the Werewolf: I\u2019ve been consistent in questioning premature claims, including James\u2019s fake check. If you\u2019re Town, then why did you wait until now to push me?
