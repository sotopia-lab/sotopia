GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act.

NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager.

(3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed.

If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Amanda, Brenda, Jennifer, Kenneth, Lisa, Donna, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Donna's) goal: Act openly and collaboratively to identify werewolves.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf.

It seems like the attack last night was prevented, which is great news for us villagers. I think the Witch might have saved someone. Since no one died, it would be helpful to hear if anyone has any suspicions or clues. Honestly, Kenneth seemed a bit quiet yesterday, which makes me curious. Does anyone else have thoughts on who might be acting suspiciously or any clues on who the Werewolves could be?\"\n\nTurn #5: Brenda: said: \"Good morning. A prevented kill likely means the Witch saved\u2014nice. I wouldn\u2019t jump on Kenneth just for being \"quiet\" before we\u2019ve heard from everyone. Seer should stay hidden unless you\u2019ve got a hard wolf. I\u2019d like quick takes from Kenneth, Jennifer, Lisa, and Donna: who would you vote right now and why? If forced to pressure-vote early, I\u2019d poke Jennifer for hanging back. Let\u2019s get reads on the table.\"\n\nTurn #6: Jennifer: said: \"Hi everyone, good morning! I agree it's useful to consider everyone's behavior, but I also think it\u2019s too early to draw conclusions when the attack was prevented. We definitely want the Seer to stay concealed until we have clearer evidence. For now, my vote would lean towards someone who seems more vocal and maybe trying to steer conversations abruptly. But it\u2019s just a hunch, and I want us to discuss this thoroughly before making any decisions. I\u2019m still gathering my observations to make an informed vote.\"\n\nTurn #7: Kenneth: said: \"Morning. No kill likely means a Witch save; Seer should stay quiet unless you\u2019ve got a hard red. Amanda, being \u201cquiet\u201d D1 isn\u2019t AI\u2014I was waiting for more content. My current lean is Jennifer: your post shades \u201csomeone steering\u201d without naming names, which feels like hedging to keep options open. Who specifically are you referring to, and give us a clear second suspect plus one townread. I want Lisa and Donna\u2019s takes before locking in, but my provisional vote would be Jennifer right now. Amanda, who are your top two? Brenda, besides your early poke on Jennifer, who else pings you?\"\n\nTurn #8: Lisa: said: \"Hello everyone, good morning! I\u2019m glad we prevented a tragedy last night with the saved life. I think it\u2019s essential to focus on getting clear reads today. I agree with Brenda and Jennifer that Seer\u2019s stay hidden unless they have definitive information. Kenneth, I\u2019m a bit concerned about Brenda targeting Jennifer based on a perceived hesitation, which could simply be cautious play rather than wolf behavior. \n\nTo answer Brenda\u2019s question, if I had to pick someone based solely on current vibes, I\u2019d keep an eye on Amanda\u2014her observation about Kenneth seemed speculative without much basis. I want to gather more evidence before locking my vote. Let\u2019s keep delving into details and pay attention to any inconsistencies in stories.\"\n\nTurn #9: Donna: said: \"Hello everyone! I'm relieved that the attack was prevented last night. It's clear we're taking good proactive steps. So far, there's a bit of initial suspicion circling, but I think it's crucial we avoid tunneling too early without more solid leads. Brenda, I agree with your strategy to get everyone to weigh in early, as more voices might bring inconsistencies to light.\n\nKenneth pointed out the perceived hedging in Jennifer's comments, and I'd also like to hear more specifics from Jennifer on who feels most suspect and why.
