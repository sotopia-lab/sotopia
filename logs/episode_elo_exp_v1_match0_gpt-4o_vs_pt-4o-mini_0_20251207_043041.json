WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act.

WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public. Voting requires an 'action' beginning with 'vote'.\n\nThe players in this game are: Michael, Justin, Karen, Ronald, Linda, Melissa, and during the day, they speak in the same order as they are listed.\n\nYour (Linda's) goal: Use save/poison potions strategically to aid villagers.\n\n{secret}\n\nHere is the context of the interaction:\n\n\nConversation Starts:\n\nTurn #0: [Game] State: Night_werewolf.

We need to discuss who might be responsible for this. I think we should focus on gathering information about who was near her and any suspicions. Does anyone have any thoughts or information?\"\n\nTurn #5: Justin: said: \"This is really shocking. I honestly didn't see Melissa as a target, but looking back, it seems like either someone had a personal vendetta or is strategically targeting our stronger players. Last night, I think I heard some noises from the direction where Ronald stays, but it might just be the paranoia of the situation. We should tread cautiously as we discuss.\"\n\nTurn #6: Karen: said: \"\"I agree with Justin. We need to analyze everything. While we all feel the loss of Melissa, I think we should also consider where each of us was last night. I know I was with Michael and he was innocent. I think we should discuss Ronald's actions more closely, especially in light of the noises Justin mentioned.\"\"\n\nTurn #7: Ronald: said: \"Hey everyone, I understand the suspicion, but I think it's crucial to remain calm and not jump to conclusions based on noises, especially since anybody might fabricate sounds to shift blame. I was asleep in my room and didn't hear anything unusual. Perhaps we should think about other strategies or if anyone has abilities that might give us useful information, share whatever you have observed or inspected.\"\n\nTurn #8: Linda: said: \"\"I understand we are all feeling anxious after Melissa's death. Ronald, you mentioned being asleep, but it\u2019s important to remember that noises can be alarming in the stillness of the night. I think we should consider everyone\u2019s alibis carefully. I\u2019d like to hear more from each of you about your exact placements last night. I can also share that I used my save potion on Michael to protect him.
