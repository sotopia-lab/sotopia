WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed.

The game begins!\n\nTurn #1: [Game] Entering state: Night_seer\n\nTurn #2: [Game] Entering state: Night_witch\n\nTurn #3: [Game] Joshua was killed by werewolves!\n[Game] Entering state: Day_discussion\n\nTurn #4: Sandra: said: \"It\u2019s shocking that Joshua was killed. I trusted him, and we need to figure out who is behind this. I suspect that the werewolves are among us, and we should keep a close eye on anyone who seems overly nervous or defensive.\"\n\nTurn #5: Pamela: said: \"It's shocking that Joshua was killed. I suspect that the werewolves are among us, and we should keep a close eye on anyone who seems overly nervous or defensive.\"\n\nTurn #6: Brandon: said: \"\"I agree, this is shocking news. But I can't help but feel that the way Pamela and Sandra are reacting is a bit too coordinated. It makes me wonder if they might be trying to deflect attention away from themselves. We should consider both of them as potential werewolves too!\"\"\n\nTurn #7: Paul: said: \"I'm thinking about the night. It's a bit unsettling, isn't it?\"\n\nTurn #8: Kathleen: said: \"It's unsettling. I need to understand their strategy. I'm trying to gauge how they are planning to react, focusing on their subtle cues and demeanor.\"\n[Game] Entering state: Day_vote\n\n\nYour available action type(s): [action].\nIt is voting time.
