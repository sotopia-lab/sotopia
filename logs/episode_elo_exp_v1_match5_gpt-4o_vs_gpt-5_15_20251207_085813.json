GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act.

NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone.

Lacking that, I\u2019ll scumread evasiveness, non-committal hedging, or parking on an easy target. I don\u2019t have strong reads yet without discussion, so I want commitments. Lisa, kick us off; Kathleen next; then Ronald, Kevin, and Larry\u2014please each name a suspect and a non-lynch. Let\u2019s stay focused; we need a wolf today.\"\n\nTurn #5: Lisa: said: \"Interesting situation we're in. The fact that no one died last night indicates quick actions were taken. However, we do still need to consider who could benefit more from this confusion. My gut tells me that Ronald was quick to make a move, and I find that suspicious, especially since he mentioned me, which could be a diversion. \n\n1) Ronald is my top suspect because he was quick to act last night, potentially knowing something we don\u2019t. \n2) I won't vote for Edward today, as his logic seems clear and he\u2019s trying to drive constructive discussion. \n\nRight now, my vote would likely go to Ronald unless someone else presents stronger evidence. Let's hear what everyone else thinks.\"\n\nTurn #6: Kathleen: said: \"Claiming Seer. I inspected Ronald last night; he is a Werewolf. Today is must-eliminate-a-wolf, so we should eliminate Ronald. Lisa\u2019s suspicion aligns with my result. 1) Top suspect: Ronald (red-check). 2) I won\u2019t vote Edward today. 3) My vote will be Ronald.\"\n\nTurn #7: Ronald: said: \"Wow, Kathleen's claim is a bold move. But here's what I think: she's not the Seer. The real Seer is being set up for a target. Seer, I urge you to stay hidden because the wolves likely acted quickly, and Kathleen is trying to provoke a mis-execution today. As for Lisa and Kathleen, it seems like they're working together to mislead us and sow doubt. \n\n1) My top suspect is Kathleen, as her supposed Seer claim came only after Lisa pointed fingers, making it feel like a setup to create a consensus against me.\n2) I won't vote for Kevin because he hasn't shown any affiliation with the wolves' agenda.\n3) Right now, my vote would be for Kathleen. Let's be wary of setups today and think before acting.\"\n\nTurn #8: Kevin: said: \"This is must-eliminate-a-wolf. A claimed Seer with a red on Ronald is our best info. If Kathleen were fake, the real Seer should counterclaim now; otherwise we follow the red. Ronald\u2019s push to keep the Seer hidden in must-lynch is not towny. \n\n1) Top suspect: Ronald.\n2) Won\u2019t vote: Kathleen (while her claim is unchallenged).\n3) My vote would be Ronald.\n\nLarry, please weigh in and explicitly say if you counterclaim Seer. If no counter, I\u2019m ready to vote Ronald.\"\n\nTurn #9: Larry: said: \"No counterclaim from me \u2014 I am not the Seer. With an uncountered red on Ronald in must-eliminate, we follow the claim. Ronald\u2019s push to keep the Seer hidden here is wolfy and his defense is posture rather than solving.\n\n1) Top suspect: Ronald (uncountered Seer red + reaction).\n2) Won\u2019t vote: Kathleen (while uncountered).\n3) My vote would be Ronald.\n\nIf any real Seer exists besides Kathleen, you must counter now; otherwise we consolidate on Ronald.
