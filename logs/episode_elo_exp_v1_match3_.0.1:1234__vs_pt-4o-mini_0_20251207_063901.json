WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone.

WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public.

WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'.

We need to discuss the implications of the witch's actions; her poison took out Karen, and we need to consider if she had a reason for it. We also need to take a closer look at who Amanda accused before her elimination. Let's make sure we pay attention to the details and not lose sight of our goal: finding the remaining Werewolves!\"\"\n\nTurn #15: Amy: said: \"This is devastating\u2014Stephanie and Karen both gone. The witch poisoned Karen, which means she\u2019s not saving anymore. That leaves only one poison left in play, and it was used on Karen. Why her? She was neutral, just trying to gather info. That makes the witch dangerous\u2014and likely aligned with the wolves. Sandra, you\u2019re the last villager left besides me. If I\u2019m the wolf, why would I kill Stephanie and let you live? But if you\u2019re the wolf... you\u2019ve been pushing blame onto Amanda and now me. The witch saved someone last night\u2014was it you? Or is she protecting the real threat? We need to ask: who benefits from Karen\u2019s death? And why did the witch choose her over saving Stephanie? I think the witch is a werewolf in disguise. We need to eliminate Sandra next\u2014she\u2019s too calm, too calculated. This isn\u2019t the behavior of a villager.\"\n\nTurn #16: Robert: said: \"\"I understand that the loss of Stephanie and Karen is weighing heavily on all of us. However, I want to highlight that Amy's accusations towards Sandra are based on a lot of speculation. I agree that the witch's decision to poison Karen was questionable, but it does not mean Sandra is behind it. We need to consider that the remaining players might be trying to sow distrust among us. Let's focus on solid evidence rather than jumping to conclusions. We need to identify the werewolves based on actions, not just claims.\"\"\n[Game] Entering state: Day_vote\n\n\nYour available action type(s): [action].\nIt is voting time.
