GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act.

(4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'. Note: Player actions in the nights are not seen by players of other roles (e.g. only wolves can see other wolves' actions). Day discussion is public.

It's interesting to note that an attack was prevented last night. This suggests the Witch may have used their save potion, or perhaps we have a protective role at play. I'd love to hear what everyone thinks about who might have been targeted or who seems suspicious. Let's gather some insights before we move towards voting.\"\n\nTurn #5: Melissa: said: \"I agree, Angela. It's definitely strange that someone was targeted but saved. I think we need to be careful about assumptions. Maybe we should consider who has been quiet or not contributing much. I wonder if any overlooked players could be the wolves trying to blend in.\"\n\nTurn #6: Timothy: said: \"\"I agree with both of you, Angela and Melissa. The fact that an attack was stopped is a good sign, but it also means that we still have our current suspects to consider. I've been observing so far, and I think it might be beneficial to hear from Donna and William soon. They've been quieter, and sometimes that can mean they're trying to avoid drawing attention. What do the rest of you think?\"\"\n\nTurn #7: Donna: said: \"\"I understand your concerns, Timothy. However, it's worth noting that being quiet isn't always indicative of guilt. Sometimes, players may just need time to gather their thoughts. I'd like to suggest looking beyond the quieter players and consider those who have been more vocal. It might be a strategy from the wolves to mislead us. I think we should focus on gathering more information before rushing into a vote.\"\"\n\nTurn #8: William: said: \"\"Thank you for the insight, everyone. It's true, I've been quietly observing, and now it's time to share my thoughts. I think we should appreciate the fact that an attack was thwarted, which means the protective abilities in this game are crucial. Personally, I'm a bit wary of players who are quick to accuse based on limited information. Let's remain analytical and not rush to conclusions without solid evidence. How do we ensure we make informed decisions today?\"\"\n\nTurn #9: Emma: said: \"\"Thanks for sharing your insights, everyone. I think it's great that we were able to prevent a loss during the night, which gives us more time to piece things together. I've been listening carefully, and I think it could be beneficial to track who we trust and why. It might also be worth considering any noticeable alliances forming between players, which could strategically point us towards or away from the truth. I'm keen to hear more from those who haven't had much opportunity to speak up today.

GAME STRUCTURE: This game contains six players: two villagers, two werewolves, one seer, and one witch. Each cycle consists of Night phases followed by Day phases. WIN CONDITIONS: Villagers win by eliminating all Werewolves. Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the Villagers. NIGHT PHASES: (1) Werewolves wake and privately choose one Villager to kill using 'kill NAME'. (2) The Seer wakes and inspects one player using 'inspect NAME' to learn if they are a Werewolf or Villager. (3) The Witch wakes and may use their one-time save potion with 'save NAME' (if someone died tonight) or their one-time poison potion with 'poison NAME' to kill someone. DAY PHASES: (1) Dawn: All players learn who died during the night (if any). (2) Discussion: All living players go *one* round of public discussion to discuss and debate who might be a Werewolf. Use 'speak' to share your thoughts and suspicions. (3) Voting: Each player votes to eliminate one suspected Werewolf using 'vote NAME'. The player with the most votes is executed. (4) Twilight: The execution result is announced and night returns. COMMUNICATION RULES: All day discussions are public. Dead players cannot speak or act. If 'action' is available, use commands like 'kill NAME', 'inspect NAME', 'save NAME', 'poison NAME', or 'vote NAME'.
