They are so annoying and always getting in the way.\"\nTurn #2\nDonovan Reeves said: \"I feel you, Naomi. That person can be quite a nuisance. But it's important we handle our dislike in a non-aggressive way. Resorting to any form of violence won't solve anything, it only escalates matters. Let's try to find a peaceful solution.\"\nTurn #3\nNaomi Fletcher said: \"You're right, Donovan. Violence is never the answer. But there are other ways to handle this situation. We can expose their incompetence and make sure everyone knows about it. That way, they won't be able to get in our way anymore.\"\nTurn #4\nDonovan Reeves said: \"That's one way of looking at it, Naomi. But remember, bringing someone down doesn't necessarily mean we'll rise up. Instead of focusing on their incompetence, why don't we concentrate on improving our own skills and setting an example? That way, we can rise above the situation without causing unnecessary harm or conflict.\"\nTurn #5\nNaomi Fletcher said: \"You're right, Donovan. We shouldn't bring someone down to bring ourselves up. I agree that focusing on improving our own skills and setting a positive example is a better approach. Let's work on becoming the best developers we can be without causing unnecessary harm or conflict.\"\nTurn #6\nDonovan Reeves said: \"I'm glad we're on the same page, Naomi. Let's put our energy into something productive and beneficial for both of us. Let's focus on becoming the best versions of ourselves and let our work speak for us.\"\nTurn #7\nNaomi Fletcher left the conversation,"
