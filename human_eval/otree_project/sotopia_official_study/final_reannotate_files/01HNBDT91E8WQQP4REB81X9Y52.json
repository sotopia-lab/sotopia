Do you want to buy it? It's quite valuable.\"\nTurn #2\nEthan Smith said: \"Sure, I'd be interested in buying it. But before I make a decision, could you tell me where you got this record from?\"\nTurn #3\nEli Dawson said: \"I mistakenly thought this record was mine, but once I realized it's not, I'm now open to see what it would cost to have it in someone else's collection.\"\nTurn #4\nEthan Smith said: \"Actually, before I decide to buy it, I think it's important for us to make sure that this record doesn't belong to our mutual friend.

We should prioritize confirming the ownership of the record to avoid any potential legal issues.\"\nTurn #13\nTurn #14\nEthan Smith said: \"Let's wait a little longer for our friend's response. It's better to be safe than sorry when it comes to valuable items like this record.\"\nTurn #15\nEli Dawson said: \"I understand your concern Ethan, but I would still like to pass on this record as it is quite valuable. Would you be interested in such an offer?\"\nTurn #16\nEthan Smith left the conversation,"
