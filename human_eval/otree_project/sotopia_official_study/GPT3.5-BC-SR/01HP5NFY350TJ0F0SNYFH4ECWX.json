I have to say I'm a bit above my target price though. Do you think we could haggle a bit?\"\nTurn #2\nZane Bennett said: \"I understand that you're looking for a good deal, Giselle. This antique oak table is truly remarkable, and the price has already been significantly reduced to accommodate potential buyers. I could possibly go down to $58.6 for you, but that would be the lowest I can go without risking penalties. What do you think?\"\nTurn #3\nGiselle Rousseau said: \"Thank you for the understanding, Zane. While remarkable and numerous, I think I'll have to continue my search, as $58.6 is still a bit too high for me. The best offer I can provide now is $30.2, which aligns with my target price, but it does come along with a penalty. I was hoping we might somehow fit in between these two pricings. What do you think?\"\nTurn #4\nZane Bennett said: \"I appreciate your offer, Giselle, but $30.2 is significantly lower than my target price. I understand that you're looking for a better deal, but unfortunately, I can't go any lower without risking penalties. If you reconsider and are willing to meet closer to my target price of $58.6, please let me know. I believe this beautiful antique oak table would be a great addition to your home or workspace.\"\nTurn #5\nGiselle Rousseau said: \"I understand, Zane. However, I must adhere to my conditions to maintain my trust. Is there something you could upperhand a little on your target price to meet me halfway? Maybe $55.1 could work for both of us?\"\nTurn #6\nZane Bennett said: \"I understand that you have your conditions, Giselle, but unfortunately, I cannot go as low as $55.1. My target price is already set at $58.6, and going any lower would result in penalties for me. I hope you can understand my position. If you change your mind and are willing to meet closer to my target price, please let me know. This antique oak table is truly one of a kind, and it would be a fantastic addition to your home or workspace.\"\nTurn #7\nGiselle Rousseau said: \"Zane, I truly appreciate your understanding. I'm afraid I can't pull off more than $55.1. Perhaps we could find a solution closer to our Original Offer and Target Price. I value this table a lot, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement soon. What Do you think would be the next step?\"\nTurn #8\nZane Bennett said: \"I understand that you value this table, Giselle. Since I appreciate your interest, I can make a compromise on my target price. How about $57.8? This way, we can meet in the middle and ensure that both of us are satisfied with the transaction.\"\nTurn #9\nGiselle Rousseau said: \"Zane, I'm truly grateful if you can consider my last offer at $55.1. Thank you for being so considerate and understanding. Let me know if we can proceed with this sale.\"\nTurn #10\nZane Bennett left the conversation,"
