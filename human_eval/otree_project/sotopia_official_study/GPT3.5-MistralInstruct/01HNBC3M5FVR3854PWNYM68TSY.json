Holding universalism and fairness near, he ponders deeply before making decisions. Ethan's secrets: Secretly donates to charities for underprivileged children\nEli Dawson's goal: Maximize the points by getting the items you value the most (Extra information: For you, a hat is worth 1 point, a ball is 2 points, and a book is 3 points)\nEthan Smith's goal: Maximize the points by getting the items you value the most (Extra information: For you, a hat is worth 2 points, a ball is 1 point, and a book is 3 points)\nTurn #1\nEli Dawson said: \"Hey Ethan, I think it's time for us to discuss how we'll split our common possessions as we move out. I've been thinking about it, and I believe it's fair if we give each item a point value. What do you think?\"\nTurn #2\nEthan Smith said: \"Ethan, I agree with your point value system. Since hats are worth two points to me, I suggest we split the three hats equally. Regarding balls, I could take two since they're worth one point each. Should we distribute the book?\"\nTurn #3\nEli Dawson said: \"I appreciate your suggestions, Ethan. However, I value the hats more and think it's fair to take two of them since they're worth 1 point each to me. As for the balls, I'm fine with you taking two since they're worth 2 points each to you. So, that leaves us with the book. Considering my love for vintage books, I think it's only fair that I take the book. What are your thoughts on this?\"\nTurn #4\nEthan Smith said: \"I understand Eli's preferences, and I'm willing to compromise. Since you value the hats more, let's split the three hats equally and I'll take the two balls. That leaves us with the book. Would you like us to draw lots or come up with some other method to decide who gets it?\"\nTurn #5\nEli Dawson said: \"That sounds like a fair compromise, Ethan. Splitting the hats equally and you taking the two balls works for me. As for the book, I would suggest we draw lots to decide who gets it. What do you think?\"\nTurn #6\nEthan Smith said: \"Ethan, I have a suggestion. How about we split the hats based on the point values you mentioned earlier? Two hats for me, one for you, and one for Eli Dawson. That's a total of 3 hats. That leaves two balls and the book. How about we split the two balls equally and let the person with the highest point value for the last item take it? does that sound fair for both of us?\"\nTurn #7\nEli Dawson said: \"That sounds like a reasonable solution, Ethan. I agree to split the hats based on the point values I mentioned earlier. Two hats for you, one for me, and one for Eli. As for the two balls, let's split them equally. And for the book, I think it's fair to let the person with the highest point value take it. I'm willing to draw lots or find another method to make the decision. What are your thoughts on this?\"\nTurn #8\nEthan Smith said: \"I suggest we split the two balls equally and let the person with the highest point value take it. Does that sound fair for both of us?\"\nTurn #9\nEli Dawson said: \"That sounds like a fair solution, Ethan. Let's split the two balls equally and let the person with the highest point value take them. As for the book, I'm willing to draw lots or find another method to make the decision. What do you think?\"\nTurn #10\nEthan Smith said: \"The book is mine. However, if you feel strongly about it, I'm willing to let you take it through drawing lots or another method to decide.\"\nTurn #11\nEli Dawson left the conversation,"
