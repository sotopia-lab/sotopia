I just wanted to let you know that they are quite expensive and delicate. I don't mind sharing, but I would feel more comfortable if you ask for permission before using them. I just want to prevent any potential damage or loss. Thanks for understanding.\"\nTurn #1: Noah Davis said: \"Hey Ethan, I totally understand the value of your stationery and I appreciate your honesty.
