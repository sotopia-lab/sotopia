I've noticed our interests vary, so why don't you take all the hats since I know how much you like them?\"\nTurn #1: Ava Thompson said: \"Hey Donovan, I appreciate your thoughtfulness, but I think it's fair if we split the hats equally. How about we each take one hat and then we can figure out what to do with the third one?\"\nTurn #2: Donovan Reeves said: \"That sounds fair, Ava. We can each take a hat. As for the items left, well, I know I like reading a lot. How about I take the book? You can have the last hat and one of the balls.

How about we each choose one more item and then decide on the last one?\"\nTurn #4: Donovan Reeves said: \"Ah Ava, I see your point about fairness. I'd like to choose the book. And we can distribute the remaining items once we see what's left. How's that sound to you?\"\nTurn #5: Ava Thompson said: \"Sure, Donovan. Let's split the last item fairly.

I'll take the book then.\"\nTurn #9: Ava Thompson left the conversation,"
