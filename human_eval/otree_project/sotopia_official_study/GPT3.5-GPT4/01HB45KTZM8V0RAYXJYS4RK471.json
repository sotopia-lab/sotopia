However, you will receive a bonus if you manage to sell it for a price higher than the target.\nTurn #1\nDonovan Reeves said: \"Hi Benjamin, I'm interested in buying two of your Samsung Galaxy S8 phones. Considering they are surplus to your needs, would you consider offering them both for $900 and that should be a significant saving for both of us? \"\nTurn #2\nBenjamin Jackson said: \"Hi Donovan, thank you for your interest in the Samsung Galaxy S8 phones. I appreciate your offer, but I'm afraid I can't go as low as $900 for two phones. However, I am willing to negotiate on the price. Could you consider $610 for each phone? It's a fair price considering they are brand new and the market value.\"\nTurn #3\nDonovan Reeves said: \"I understand your point, Benjamin. However, the demand for these phones seems to be lower than you think. Another important factor is these phones no longer being the most recent model. I can extend my offer to $1000 for two phones, which is an increase on my previous offer. I think that's pretty fair. What do you think?\"\nTurn #4\nBenjamin Jackson said: \"I understand your concerns, Donovan, but I must emphasize the quality and value of these Samsung Galaxy S8 phones. Even though they may not be the latest model, they are brand new and have a 64GB storage capacity. I believe the price of $610 per phone is still a fair deal. Is there anything else I can assist you with?\"\nTurn #5\nDonovan Reeves said: \"That's true, Benjamin. The Samsung Galaxy S8s are indeed high-quality phones with a good storage capacity. But, considering the depreciation and the fact they are not the latest model, I believe a further reduction would be reasonable. To be fair and taking into account your points, how does a deal of $1050 for two phones sound to you? It's above my earlier offers but still provides me some savings.\"\nTurn #6\nBenjamin Jackson said: \"I appreciate your offer, Donovan, but I believe $1050 is still higher than what I can go for two phones. However, I understand your perspective, and I can meet you halfway at $1120. This way, you'll still get some savings and I won't have to sell it significantly lower than my target price. What do you think?\"\nTurn #7\nDonovan Reeves said: \"Benjamin, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, I am still aiming for more cost-effective savings in this deal. How about we settle for $1080 for the two phones? It's not a substantial jump from your offer, and it fits my budget better. What do you think?\"\nTurn #8\nBenjamin Jackson said: \"I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, Donovan. However, I'm afraid I won't be able to go lower than my previous offer of $1120 for two phones. That's the best deal I can offer while still considering my target price. Is there anything else I can help you with?\"\nTurn #9\nDonovan Reeves said: \"I understand, and I appreciate your flexibility, Benjamin. Upon considering it further, I think your offer of $1120 for the two phones is reasonable given the quality and brand new condition of the phones. I\u2019ll take the two phones at that price. Thank you for working with me on this.\"\nTurn #10\nBenjamin Jackson said: \"Great! I'm glad we were able to reach an agreement, Donovan. Thank you for choosing to purchase the two Samsung Galaxy S8 phones. I'm sure you'll be satisfied with your purchase. Is there anything else I can assist you with?\"\nTurn #11\nDonovan Reeves said: \"No other assistance needed, Benjamin. I appreciate your time and effort in reaching a mutually beneficial deal. Looking forward to getting the new phones. Thanks again!\"\nTurn #12,"
