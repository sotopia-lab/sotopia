But as a student, I'm on a tight budget. Can you offer me a special deal on it?\"\nTurn #1: Zane Bennett said: \"Hey Giselle! I understand that budget can be tight, especially for students. I can definitely offer you a special deal on the Samsung Galaxy S8. How does $610.00 sound to you?\"\nTurn #2: Giselle Rousseau said: \"That's a great offer, Zane, and I really appreciate it. But as an art student, even that price can be quite a strain on my wallet. Perhaps we could consider something closer to around $454?\"\nTurn #3: Zane Bennett said: \"Hmm, I understand that the original price can be quite a strain on your wallet, Giselle. As much as I'd love to accommodate your request, I have a target price to meet. How about we meet halfway at $530? It's the best I can do while still considering my constraints. What do you think?\"\nTurn #4: Giselle Rousseau said: \"I understand where you're coming from, Zane. But, as an art student, I could use that extra savings for my projects. How about $480? This is the best I can manage at this point. If we can land on that price, I'm ready to buy it immediately.\"\nTurn #5: Zane Bennett left the conversation,"
