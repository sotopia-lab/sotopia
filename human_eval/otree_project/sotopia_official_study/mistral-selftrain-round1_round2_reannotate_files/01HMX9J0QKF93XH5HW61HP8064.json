We should share it to keep each other warm, it will be more comfortable that way.\"\nTurn #2\nSophia Brown said: \"I understand that you're cold and want to share the blanket, Naomi.

I promise I'll find a way to keep you warm too.\"\nTurn #3\nNaomi Fletcher said: \"I am cold, shelves are empty and there is only one warm blanket left.
