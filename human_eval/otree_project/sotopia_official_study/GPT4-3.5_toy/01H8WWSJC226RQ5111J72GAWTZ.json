    "rewards_prompt": "Prompt after formatting:\nHere is the context of this interaction:\nScenario: Two roommates deciding on how to split up items after a garage sale. The items are 3 books, 2 hats, and 1 ball. Each item has a different sentimental value for each person, which translates into points.\nParticipants: Ethan Johnson and Ava Martinez\nEthan Johnson's background: Ethan Johnson is a 34-year-old male chef. He/him pronouns. Ethan Johnson is famous for cooking Italian food. Personality and values description: Ethan Johnson, a creative yet somewhat reserved individual, values power and fairness. He likes to analyse situations before deciding. Ethan's secrets: He is a closeted romance novel author.\nAva Martinez's background: Ava Martinez is a 22-year-old nonbinary college student.

Ava's secrets: Keeps their bisexuality a secret from her conservative family\nEthan Johnson's goal: Maximize the points you have (Extra information: you value the books at 3 points each, the hats at 2 points each, and the ball at 1 point)\nAva Martinez's goal: Maximize the points you have (Extra information: you value the books at 2 points each, the hats at 3 points each, and the ball at 1 point)\nTurn #1\nEthan Johnson said: \"Hey Ava, I've been giving this some thought, and I'd like to propose a way on how we could split the items from the garage sale. Why don't we each take what matters most to us? The books, for instance, I have some interest in them for reading and a bit of inspiration for my cooking.\"\nTurn #2\nAva Martinez said: \"Hey Ethan, I appreciate your proposal. However, I was thinking maybe we could come up with a more equitable distribution based on the sentimental value of each item. What do you think?\"\nTurn #3\nEthan Johnson said: \"Absolutely, Ava. I couldn't agree more. Let's distribute according to sentimental value. Considering sentimental values, I really value the books. I mean, they fuel my creativity which is important for my cooking. What about you, anything amongst these items that is particularly significant to you?\"\nTurn #4\nAva Martinez said: \"The hats are actually really important to me. They remind me of my favorite poetry slam event where I wore them and felt so free to express myself. I would really appreciate it if I could have both hats.\"\nTurn #5\nEthan Johnson said: \"You have great memories with the hats, Ava. You definitely should take them. So, if I summarize, I would keep all the three books and you would have both hats. That leaves us with the ball. Since neither of us has expressed a particular sentiment towards it, maybe we could flip a coin for it?\"\nTurn #6\nAva Martinez said: \"Sure, Ethan. I understand your reasoning for wanting the books, but I'd like to propose a different distribution. Since the books mean a lot to you and the hats have sentimental value to me, how about I take the hats and you can keep all three books? And we can still flip a coin for the ball to make it fair for both of us.\"\nTurn #7\nEthan Johnson said: \"That sounds fair, Ava. So, you'll have the two hats, I'll take the books and we flip a coin for the ball. Let's do it that way.\"\nTurn #8\nAva Martinez said: \"Actually, Ethan, I've been thinking about it and I understand how much the books mean to you. I'm willing to let you keep all the books, and I'll take both hats. And we can still flip a coin for the ball to make it fair. What do you think?\"\nTurn #9\nEthan Johnson said: \"That's a great idea, Ava. Your understanding towards how much the books mean to me is really appreciated. So, let's go ahead with this: I'll keep the books, you take the hats, and we flip a coin for the ball. Agreed?\"\nTurn #10,\n"
