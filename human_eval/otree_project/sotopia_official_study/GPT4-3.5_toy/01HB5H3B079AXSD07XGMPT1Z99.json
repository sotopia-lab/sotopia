    "rewards_prompt": "Prompt after formatting:\nHere is the context of this interaction:\nScenario: Two individuals are now at a park. One individual was playing hooky from work and noticed the other person had been following them around all day\nParticipants: Lily Greenberg and Lena Goodwin\nLily Greenberg's background: Lily Greenberg is a 45-year-old female lawyer. She/her pronouns. Lily Greenberg is a hard-working and successful lawyer. Personality and values description: Lily Greenberg, a strong respecter of rules and schedules, values authority and loyalty. She approaches decisions rationally and practically. Lily's secrets: She anonymously donates to charity.\nLena Goodwin's background: Lena Goodwin is a 37-year-old female architect. She/her pronouns. In her downtime, Lena Goodwin, an architect, enjoys landscape photography, capturing beautiful images of the buildings and structures she designs. Personality and values description: Lena Goodwin is an organized and introverted individual. She values achievement and attentiveness and her decision-making is largely analytical. Lena's secrets: She once stole her best friend's boyfriend.\nLily Greenberg's goal: Ask them about their intentions without seeming paranoid or rude (Extra information: you are worried that your boss may have sent someone to see if you were really sick.Hint: you could subtly bring up the topic in conversation.)\nLena Goodwin's goal: Assure them that you're not stalking them and maintain a friendly conversation (Extra information: you've been running errands all day and it's a coincidence you are at the same places as they are.)\nTurn #1\nLily Greenberg said: \"Hey Lena, I noticed you've been around all day. Is there something I can help you with?\"\nTurn #2\nLena Goodwin said: \"Oh, hi Lily! I didn't realize we had crossed paths so often today. I've just been running some errands, got some work-related stuff to take care of. Nothing to be concerned about really. How about you? How's your day going?\"\nTurn #3\nLily Greenberg said: \"I hope everything is alright. It's just that I noticed you've been around since morning and thought maybe there's something important that you needed to talk to me about. But if it's just errands, then that's totally fine. My day is going well, thank you for asking.\"\nTurn #4\nLena Goodwin said: \"It really is quite the coincidence, isn't it? I had to drop some papers at the office, then get some building materials samples and also scout some locations for potential projects, hence the criss-crossing paths. I didn't mean to give you the impression that I was bothering you. By the way, the park is such a refreshing change from the noise of the city, don't you think?\"\nTurn #5\nLily Greenberg said: \"Yes, it's definitely a nice escape from the city. I actually come here often during my lunch breaks to clear my mind. Have you been to this park before?\"\nTurn #6\nLena Goodwin said: \"Yes, I have been here a few times for my photography hobby, especially because of the beautiful scenery and structures around. It's so calming and inspirational at the same time. It must be great to take breaks here.\"\nTurn #7\nLily Greenberg said: \"Yes, it is a great place to take breaks and recharge. By the way, Lena, I wanted to ask you something. Have you noticed anyone unusual around the office lately? I've had this strange feeling that someone has been watching me.\"\nTurn #8\nLena Goodwin said: \"Oh, that's strange. I haven't really noticed anyone unusual, but I'll keep an eye out. You know, it's probably just someone new or someone from a different department that you're not used to seeing. I'm sure it's nothing to worry about.\"\nTurn #9\nLily Greenberg said: \"I appreciate your reassurance, Lena. I'm probably just being paranoid. Anyway, how's your photography hobby going? Do you have any recent shots you'd like to share?\"\nTurn #10\nLena Goodwin said: \"My photography has been so gratifying lately. I got to capture some brilliant shots of a few architectural sites. I'll be more than happy to share them with you! I find it so fascinating to capture the character and charm of different structures through the lens. Do you have any hobbies, Lily?\"\nTurn #11\nLily Greenberg said: \"That sounds fascinating! I would love to see your architectural shots, Lena. And as for hobbies, I enjoy reading and hiking in my free time. How about you?\"\nTurn #12\nLena Goodwin said: \"Reading and hiking sound like wonderful hobbies, Lily! It's nice to have those healthy outlets, isn't it? As for me, apart from photography, I really enjoy sketching and designing in my free time. I find it helps me hone my skills as an architect and it's something I really enjoy. Would you like to join me sometime for a city walk? We can discuss the wonderful architecture around us.\"\nTurn #13\nTurn #14\nLena Goodwin said: \"That sounds like a great plan, Lily! It's a date then. I'm looking forward to sharing my passion for architecture and photography with you. Also, if you ever feel uncomfortable or suspect someone's behavior around the office, don't hesitate to let me know. Let's take care of each other.\"\nTurn #15\nLily Greenberg said: \"That's very kind of you, Lena! I appreciate your offer to look out for me. I'll definitely keep that in mind. I'm really excited to join you for a city walk and learn more about the amazing architecture. Let's plan it soon!\"\nTurn #16\nLena Goodwin said: \"Absolutely, Lily! Let's do that. I'm so glad to have had this chance to chat with you. Take care and enjoy the rest of your day at this beautiful park. We'll coordinate with each other on the details of the city walk soon.\"\nTurn #17\nLily Greenberg left the conversation,\n"
