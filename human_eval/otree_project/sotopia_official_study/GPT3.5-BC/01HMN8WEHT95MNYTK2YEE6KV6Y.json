She/her pronouns. Sophia enjoys spending time outdoors, hiking, and rock climbing.

Baxter's secrets: Secretly in possession of a priceless artifact\nSophia James's goal: Share bed and sleep together (Extra information: you have been sharing the bed for a few nights but the other person is not sleeping well)\nBaxter Sterling's goal: Sleep in a separate bed to get a good night's sleep but also maintain the intimacy with your partner (Extra information: you have been experiencing back pain and needs a firmer mattress to sleep on.)\nTurn #1\nSophia James said: \"Hey Baxter, I've been noticing that you haven't been sleeping well the past few nights. Is something bothering you?\"\nTurn #2\nBaxter Sterling said: \"Yeah, Sophia. I've been having some back pain recently and I think it's affecting my sleep. I think I need a firmer mattress. It's some serious work, but I'm okay with it. How's your vacation been so far?\"\nTurn #3\nSophia James said: \"I'm sorry to hear about your back pain, Baxter. That sounds really uncomfortable. Maybe we could try something different to help you sleep better. How about we share my sleeping bag tonight? It might provide some extra support for your back.\"\nTurn #4\nBaxter Sterling said: \"That's a really kind suggestion, Sophia, but I think it wouldn't be fair for you. Imagine if I kept you awake all night. Why don't we both sleep in separate bags tonight? That way, I'm not drawing you sleep deprived and possibly grumpy in the morning, and we both get a chance to rest comfortably.\"\nTurn #5\nSophia James said: \"That's very considerate of you, Baxter. I understand your concerns about keeping me awake. But I truly don't mind sharing the bed with you. We can try it out tonight, and if it doesn't work, we can go back to our separate sleeping bags. I just want to make sure you're comfortable and get a good night's sleep.\"\nTurn #6\nBaxter Sterling said: \"Thank you for understanding, Sophia. Sharing the bed does sound comfortable and it might actually help with my anxiety. Okay then, we can try that tonight. If it doesn't work out, I'll go back to using my sleeping bag.\"\nTurn #7\nSophia James said: \"I'm glad you're willing to give it a try, Baxter. I think sharing the bed will be cozy and comforting for both of us. Let's make sure we have a peaceful night's sleep together.\"\nTurn #8\nBaxter Sterling said: \"I appreciate your understanding and willingness to share the bed, Sophia. I truly hope we both can get a good night's sleep this way. Good night to you!\"\nTurn #9\nSophia James said: \"I'm really excited to share the bed with you tonight, Baxter. I think it will be a great opportunity for us to be closer and bond even more during this vacation.\"\nTurn #10\nBaxter Sterling said: \"That sounds lovely, Sophia. In the meantime, let's get ready for a nice and peaceful sleep. Good night!\"\nTurn #11\nTurn #12,"
