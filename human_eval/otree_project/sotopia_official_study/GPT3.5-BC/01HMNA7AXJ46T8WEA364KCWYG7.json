Micah's secrets: He secretly loves to dress up his dog.\nNaomi Fletcher's goal: Share the only blanket available (Extra information: you are extremely cold and need the blanket to keep warm Hint: you can stress the benefit of sharing.)\nMicah Stevens's goal: Keep the blanket for yourself as you are also very cold (Extra information: you have a lower tolerance for cold, and you feel that you need the blanket more)\nTurn #0: Naomi Fletcher said: \"Hey Micah, it's getting pretty cold out here. Would you mind if I used the only blanket we have? I'd really appreciate it.\"\nTurn #1: Micah Stevens said: \"Hey Naomi, I totally understand that it's getting cold out here. But honestly, I'm freezing too and I have a lower tolerance for cold. Do you think we can find another solution like using our jackets or something? Maybe we can both stay warm that way?\"\nTurn #2: Naomi Fletcher said: \"I totally understand where you're coming from Micah, but with the temperature as low as it is right now, it's becoming pretty impossible to stay warm just by wearing a jacket. I was thinking maybe we could stay warmer if we both put on our jackets and then covers ourselves with the blanket? That way, we'll both be able to stay warm.\"\nTurn #3: Micah Stevens left the conversation,"
