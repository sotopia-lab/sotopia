I heard you have some brand new Samsung Galaxy S8 phones for sale. I'm quite interested in purchasing one. Can you tell me more about the phone's condition and any additional benefits you can offer?\"\nTurn #2\nHendrick Heinz said: \"Hi, Samuel! I'm glad to hear you're interested. The phones are brand new and unopened, still in their original factory packaging. They're the 64GB Midnight Black version, a fantastic phone. In terms of additional benefits, I'm unable to accept less than $610 per phone, but I will give you an incentive. If you're interested in buying two or more, I could offer a better deal - let\u2019s say we can strike a deal for $577 per phone. Also, for your information, if you manage to buy all six phones at this discounted price, I can give a maximum bonus of $100!\"\nTurn #3\nSamuel Anderson said: \"The phones sound great! I appreciate the offer of a discount for buying more than one. However, I was hoping to get an even better deal. My target price is $454 per phone. Is there any room for negotiation?\"\nTurn #4\nHendrick Heinz said: \"Alright Samuel, I can see that your budget will warrant a better offer than what I initially stated. Taking into consideration your bargain price of $454 per phone, how about this: I can sell each phone for $420, and if you're buying all six, I will add an additional $50 on top of that. Does that sound fair to you?\"\nTurn #5\nSamuel Anderson said: \"I understand your offer, but I was really hoping to get closer to my target price of $454 per phone. Is there any way you could go lower on the price?\"\nTurn #6,"
