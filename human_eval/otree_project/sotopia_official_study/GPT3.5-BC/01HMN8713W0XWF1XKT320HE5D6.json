It's time for us to split our common possessions as we're moving out of the apartment. I think it would be fair if we discuss how to divide them. What are your thoughts on that?\"\nTurn #2\nEthan Smith said: \"Hey Eli, thanks for bringing this up. I agree it's fair to discuss how to divide our items. Given their points assigned, how about we divide the possessions according to their value? That is, the hat and the two balls would be one point each, and the book, being the most valuable, would be three points. Does that sound good to you?\"\nTurn #3\nEli Dawson said: \"That sounds like a fair way to divide our possessions based on their value. I appreciate your suggestion, Ethan. However, I was wondering if we could also consider our personal preferences when dividing the items. For example, I value vintage books and would love to keep the book if possible. What do you think about considering both the value and our personal preferences?\"\nTurn #4\nEthan Smith said: \"Sure Eli, considering our personal preferences does make sense. If the book means more to you than its points assigned, it's reasonable to avoid the likelihood of losing it. Given these points, how about we take turns for the hats and balls? You can have whichever you find most valuable and I'll take the other one.\"\nTurn #5\nEli Dawson said: \"That sounds like a fair proposal, Ethan. I appreciate your willingness to consider personal preferences. Since I value vintage books, I would like to keep the book. So, if you don't mind, I'll take the book. As for the hats and balls, your idea of taking turns for them works for me. I will choose one, and you can have the other. Does that sound agreeable to you?\"\nTurn #6,"
