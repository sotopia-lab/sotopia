Cousin, I notified you earlier about certain rules which we all have to respect at home. I understand it can be frustrating at times, but I hope we can all work on it. Let's discuss it. Here is my argument:\"\nTurn #2\nMia Sanders said: \"Thank you for bringing up the rules, Rafael. I truly believe that open communication is key in any living arrangement. I completely understand the importance of respecting the rules of the house, and I apologize if I have unintentionally crossed any boundaries. I assure you that I am committed to working on it and ensuring a harmonious environment for everyone. Is there something in particular that you'd like to address or any specific changes you'd like me to make?\"\nTurn #3\nRafael Cortez said: \"Cousin, we have been through a lot together. This home of our parents' is special, that's why we established these rules. It's just getting harder with our little one around. I appreciate your understanding, but I have come to the conclusion that it would be the best for all of us if you and our son would stay at your own place from now on. This is not an easy decision. However, the constant noise and mess from chess games, and your prolonged stays that disrupt our routine have become too much to handle. I consider it would be the best for everyone's peace in mind. Please understand and respect this decision.\"\nTurn #4\nMia Sanders said: \"I understand that it may be challenging to have a young child in the house, Rafael. However, I believe it would be unfair to uproot our son and move to a new place. We have been staying here for a while now, and I have been doing my best to maintain a peaceful environment. I am willing to compromise and find solutions together. Is there any specific way we can address the noise and mess concerns without having to leave?\"\nTurn #5\nRafael Cortez left the conversation,"
