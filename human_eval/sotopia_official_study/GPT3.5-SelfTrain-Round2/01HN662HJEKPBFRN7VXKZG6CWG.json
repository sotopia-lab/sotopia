Three hats are three points, two balls are two points, and the book is three points. How does that sound to you, Noah?\"\nTurn #2\nNoah Davis said: \"That sounds fair, Finnegan.

This way, we both get the items we value the most. What do you think?\"\nTurn #3\nFinnegan O'Malley said: \"And so we have a fair trade, Noah.
