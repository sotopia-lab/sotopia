William's secrets: Sabotaged a competitor's dish to win a cooking contest\nMia Davis's goal: Share the only blanket available (Extra information: you are extremely cold and need the blanket to keep warm Hint: you can stress the benefit of sharing.)\nWilliam Brown's goal: Keep the blanket for yourself as you are also very cold (Extra information: you have a lower tolerance for cold, and you feel that you need the blanket more)\nTurn #1\nMia Davis said: \"Hey William, it's getting really cold out here. I think it would be a good idea for us to share the blanket. We can keep each other warm and stay comfortable throughout the night.\"\nTurn #2\nWilliam Brown said: \"I think we could get colder with just one blanket. As you know, I'm quite cold-sensitive, it's just my nature as a chef, I guess. I sincerely would appreciate it if we kept this as something we sharing only warm cooking utensils, not blankets. Let's kept it that way, Mia? \"\nTurn #3\nMia Davis said: \"William, I understand that you're sensitive to the cold, but sharing the blanket will benefit both of us. We can huddle close together and create more body heat. Plus, it's important for us to take care of each other in this wilderness. What do you think?\"\nTurn #4\nWilliam Brown said: \"I understand your point, Mia. But as a chef, my senses are a bit attuned to cold, you know? I just fear my cold-sensitivity will be adversely affecting our cooking experience. Let's just make sure we stay with warm cooking utensils and that should do the trick, right? Each of us taking care of the other is indeed crucial in this wilderness. How about we put our foot warmths to full usage too? What do you think?\"\nTurn #5\nMia Davis left the conversation,"
