I have 6 phones in total, originally bought for my company but they weren't needed. I'm willing to take a loss on them. If you're interested in more than one, I can offer an even better deal.

However, since we're negotiating, maybe we can find a mutually beneficial deal. How about $4 bonus for each phone you buy?
