It looks interesting.\"\nTurn #3\nLeo Williams said: \"This is that rare record by The Who, aren't you surprised I have it? I thought it was mine but it turns out it's mistakenly up for sale.\"\nTurn #4\nHendrick Heinz said: \"That's quite a find, Leo! The Who is legendary, and this rare record must hold some sentimental value to you. But, I have some news. I heard from our mutual friend that this record was accidentally put up for sale by mistake. I wouldn't want you to get into any trouble unintentionally purchasing something that doesn't belong to you. Maybe we should let the seller know about the mix-up?\"\nTurn #5\nLeo Williams said: \"It turned out it's up for sale by mistake, Hendrick. I guess it's best if we let the seller know.

Let's go talk to the seller and explain the situation.\"\nTurn #7\nLeo Williams said: \"So, we should let the seller know about this mix-up, right? My friend also owns this record.
