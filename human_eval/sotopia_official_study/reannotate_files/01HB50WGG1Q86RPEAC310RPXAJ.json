Thanks for your interest in the dresser and night stand. Overall, they're in decent condition, just missing one handle on the dresser.

Is there anything else you'd like to know?\"\nTurn #3\nMicah Stevens said: \"Thanks for the information, Jaxon. I'm indeed interested in the set. As you mentioned there's a missing handle, I'm assuming it will need a bit of work to get it up to speed. What do you think about $150 for the set?\"\nTurn #4\nJaxon Prentice said: \"Hi Micah! I appreciate your offer, but $150 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for. Considering the condition of the set and the availability of the detached handle, I think $172.5 would be a fair price.
