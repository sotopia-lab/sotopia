Could you tell me a bit more about their condition?\"\nTurn #1: Noah Davis said: \"Of course, Ethan. The Dresser and Matching Night Stand are in decent condition overall. There is just one small issue, as the dresser is missing one handle. However, I still have the detached handle, so it could potentially be re-attached. Other than that, they are both in good shape.\"\nTurn #2: Ethan Smith said: \"Thanks for sharing, Noah. I appreciate your honesty about the missing handle. Could you let me know what price you were thinking of selling it for?\"\nTurn #3: Noah Davis said: \"I was thinking of selling the Dresser and Matching Night Stand for $200.00. However, since you showed interest in purchasing it, I can offer you a special price of $172.5, which is a 15% discount. What do you think?\"\nTurn #4: Ethan Smith said: \"Thanks for offering me a special price, Noah. I'm definitely interested in the Dresser and Matching Night Stand. However, considering the missing handle and the potential cost of re-attaching it, I was hoping to get it for a slightly lower price. Would you consider lowering it to $152.0?

Considering the missing handle and the potential cost of re-attaching it, I am willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $162.0. This price takes into account the discount I already offered and takes into consideration the work needed for the handle. How does that sound to you?\"\nTurn #8: Ethan Smith said: \"I understand the work needed for the handle, Noah. However, my maximum budget for the Dresser and Matching Night Stand is $152.0. Is there any possibility of negotiating the price to meet my budget?\"\nTurn #9: Noah Davis said: \"I appreciate your budget constraints, Ethan, but unfortunately, my target price for the Dresser and Matching Night Stand is $172.5. I understand if that doesn't work for you, and I wish you the best in finding a suitable piece of furniture within your budget.\"\nTurn #10: Ethan Smith left the conversation,"
