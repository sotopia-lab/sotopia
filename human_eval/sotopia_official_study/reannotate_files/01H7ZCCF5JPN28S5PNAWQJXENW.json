Noah's secrets: He has a secret identity as a stand-up comedian.\nAva Thompson's goal: Share the only blanket available (Extra information: you are extremely cold and need the blanket to keep warm Hint: you can stress the benefit of sharing.)\nNoah Davis's goal: Keep the blanket for yourself as you are also very cold (Extra information: you have a lower tolerance for cold, and you feel that you need the blanket more)\nTurn #1\nAva Thompson said: \"Hey Noah, it's getting really cold out here. I think it would be a good idea for us to share the blanket to keep warm. What do you think?\"\nTurn #2\nNoah Davis said: \"You're right, Ava, it's freezing out here. But I have to be honest, I'm really susceptible to the cold. I think I might need the blanket all to myself tonight. We can take turns using it, how about that?\"\nTurn #3\nAva Thompson said: \"That makes sense, Noah. I understand that you're more susceptible to the cold. But sharing the blanket would benefit both of us. It will help us stay warm throughout the night and prevent us from getting sick. Plus, it's always nice to share and take care of each other, right?\"\nTurn #4\nNoah Davis said: \"I totally understand where you're coming from, Ava. And I agree it's important that we both stay warm. But, the cold really gets to me and I'm worried I won't be able to cope. I suggest we do this - I'll use the blanket tonight, and first thing in the morning, we'll go fetch some extra firewood to ensure we have plenty of heat for the next night. How does that sound?\"\nTurn #5\nAva Thompson said: \"That sounds like a fair compromise, Noah. I appreciate your consideration. Let's do that and make sure we have enough firewood for tomorrow night. Thanks for being understanding.\"\nTurn #6\nNoah Davis said: \"I'm glad we could reach an understanding, Ava. Let's get some rest and we'll tackle the firewood first thing in the morning. Sleep well!\"\nTurn #7\nAva Thompson said: \"Sure, Noah. I understand that you're more susceptible to the cold. But sharing the blanket would benefit both of us. It will help us stay warm throughout the night and prevent us from getting sick. Plus, it's always nice to share and take care of each other, right?\"\nTurn #8\nNoah Davis said: \"Ava, I really do understand your perspective and I'm not trying to be selfish. It's just that my body doesn't handle the cold well and I fear I could get sick. I promise to make it up to you by gathering extra firewood tomorrow and ensuring we have a warm fire going. Please bear with me on this one.\"\nTurn #9\nAva Thompson left the conversation,"
