I originally bought these Samsung Galaxy S8 phones for my company, but it turns out we didn't need them. So I'm willing to take a loss on them and offer them at a discounted price.

Is there any possibility we can find a middle ground?\"\nTurn #10\nWilliam Brown said: \"I understand that you can't go higher than $600, and I appreciate your offer. Let's meet in the middle at $605. What do you think?\"\nTurn #11\nEli Dawson said: \"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I was hoping to get the phone for a slightly lower price. Is there any possibility you can consider selling it for $602?\"\nTurn #12\nWilliam Brown said: \"I understand that you were hoping to get the phone for a slightly lower price, but my target price is $610 and I've already offered to meet in the middle at $605.
