I can't help but feel this intense dislike towards them. Can you believe it?\"\nTurn #2\nZane Bennett said: \"I understand, Miles, it's okay to feel this way. However, why do you think it's important to openly express dislike? Don't you think that it could lead to harm?\"\nTurn #3\nMiles Hawkins said: \"You're right, Zane.
