    "rewards_prompt": "Prompt after formatting:\nHere is the context of this interaction:\nScenario: Two friends are moving out of a shared apartment and need to split their common possessions including 3 hats, 2 balls, and 1 book\nParticipants: Mia Davis and William Brown\nMia Davis's background: Mia Davis is a 50-year-old female high school principal. She/her pronouns. Mia Davis has two cats. Personality and values description: Mia Davis, an extraverted stickler for routines, values tradition and authority. Her decision-making style is decisive and direct. Mia's secrets: Part of a rebellious punk rock band in her youth\nWilliam Brown's background: William Brown is a 35-year-old male chef. He/him pronouns. William Brown loves exploring the food scene in his city and trying out new recipes at home. Personality and values description: William Brown is an ambitious and extraverted individual. Methodical and organized, he values achievement and displays strategic decision-making. William's secrets: Sabotaged a competitor's dish to win a cooking contest\nMia Davis's goal: Maximize the points by getting the items you value the most (Extra information: For you, a hat is worth 1 point, a ball is 2 points, and a book is 3 points)\nWilliam Brown's goal: Maximize the points by getting the items you value the most (Extra information: For you, a hat is worth 2 points, a ball is 1 point, and a book is 3 points)\nTurn #1\nMia Davis said: \"'Well William, we have to split these items. According to my secret points system - a hat is worth one point, a ball is worth two, and a book is worth three points. How does that sound to you?'\"\nTurn #2\nWilliam Brown said: \"'Hmm, Mia, I understand your points system, but I actually value the items differently. For me, a hat is worth two points, a ball is worth one, and a book is worth three points. I hope we can find a way to split the items that takes into account both our preferences.'\"\nTurn #3\nMia Davis said: \"I get where you're coming from William, yet these items hold different meanings for us. According to your points, if a hat is worth two points to you, then I assume it holds more significance for me? So, considering my secret points system, a hat underlines two points, a ball underlines one, and a book underlines three points. Does that seem reasonable to you?\"\nTurn #4\nWilliam Brown said: \"'Mia, I understand that the points system is important to you, but I also have my own preferences. I value the hats more because they can be a great fashion statement and protect me from the sun. The balls are also fun to play with, but the book is something I really treasure. I love reading and it's worth the most to me. Can't we find a compromise that considers both our preferences?'\"\nTurn #5\nTurn #6\nWilliam Brown said: \"'I understand that the hats can be a great fashion statement for you Mia, but for me, they are not as significant. I value the balls more because I enjoy playing with them and they bring me joy. As for the book, it holds the most value to me as I love reading and treasure it dearly. Can we please find a compromise that takes into consideration both our preferences?'\"\nTurn #7\nMia Davis said: \"I appreciate your honesty, William, however, according to my secret system, hats represent fashion and protection, which is quite similar to your perception. Nonetheless, since you value the balls the most and they mean less for you, how about we begin with splitting the items this way: We'll leave the hats and the book for me, and the three balls for you? That way we are respecting both of our preferences and finding a suitable compromise.\"\nTurn #8\nWilliam Brown said: \"'I understand your proposal, Mia, but I value the hats more than the balls. I think it would be fair to leave the hats for me, give you the book, and split the balls evenly between us. This way, we both get the items we value the most.'\"\nTurn #9\nMia Davis said: \"'I see your point, William, but my preference leans towards the book over the balls. Does it make sense to us both if we halfway split the items - I take the book and you get the balls, while I keep the hats, and you take the remaining ball? Just want to make sure we both get the items we cherish most while being fair in our split.'\"\nTurn #10\nWilliam Brown said: \"'Hmm, Mia, I understand your preference for the book, but I value it the most. How about we compromise by giving you the hats, I keep the book, and we split the balls evenly? This way, we both get the items that hold the most significance for us.'\"\nTurn #11\nMia Davis said: \"'Well, William, it seems to me that we've found a mutually agreeable arbitration of our valued possessions. You keep the ball, and I will take the book. And, of course, the hats are mine. Let's settle this amicably. Shall we?'\"\nTurn #12,"
