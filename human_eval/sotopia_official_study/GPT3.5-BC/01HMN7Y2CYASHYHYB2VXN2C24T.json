    "rewards_prompt": "Prompt after formatting:\nHere is the context of this interaction:\nScenario: Two friends participating in a charity event for children in Syria\nParticipants: Leo Williams and Hendrick Heinz\nLeo Williams's background: Leo Williams is a 37-year-old male dentist. He/him pronouns. Leo Williams often spends his time playing with his young daughter whom he cherishes dearly. Personality and values description: Leo Williams, despite being quiet, values security and care for others. He's a rational decision-maker focussing on best outcomes. Leo's secrets: He has a secret child from a previous relationship.\nHendrick Heinz's background: Hendrick Heinz is a 54-year-old male chef. He/him pronouns. Hendrick Heinz hosts monthly wine tasting nights with his peers. Personality and values description: Hendrick Heinz, though somewhat impulsive, values hedonism and conformity. He combines practicality with decisiveness in decision-making. Hendrick's secrets: Faked his culinary credentials to secure prestigious employment\nLeo Williams's goal: Convince your friend to donate more funds to the cause (Extra information: Your friend initially planned to donate $200, but you believe they could afford to donate $500)\nHendrick Heinz's goal: Maintain financial stability while supporting the cause (Extra information: You only have $300 set aside for donations and other expenses, and you are not comfortable about exceeding this budget.)\nTurn #1\nLeo Williams said: \"Hey Hendrick, thanks for joining me in this charity event for children in Syria. It's such an important cause, and I'm really glad we can contribute together.\"\nTurn #2\nHendrick Heinz said: \"Glad to see we could participate in this, Leo. As for the cause, it's truly heart-wrenching what these children are going through. Regarding the event, let's keep things within the budget I've set for myself, okay? I need to ensure I can meet my financial obligations while still contributing to this.\"\nTurn #3\nLeo Williams said: \"I completely understand the need to stick to your budget, Hendrick. But considering the importance of the cause and the impact we can make, do you think we could increase our donation? Even a small increase can make a big difference in the lives of these children.\"\nTurn #4\nHendrick Heinz said: \"I truly agree with you, Leo, and kind hearts like ours, have a moral obligation to extend assistance wherever it's needed. However, due to my financial obligations, I can't extend our donation beyond the budget I've set for myself. It's still a considerable amount, though. We may not change everything at once but every little help counts, right? Let's continue pushing this cause forward in all the ways we can.\"\nTurn #5\nLeo Williams said: \"I really appreciate your willingness to contribute, Hendrick. I understand that you have financial obligations to meet, but I want to share something with you. As a father myself, I can't help but think about the children in Syria who are going through unimaginable struggles. My daughter is the light of my life, and I can't bear to imagine what it would be like for her to experience the kind of hardships those children are facing. It's because of this that I feel compelled to do as much as I can to help. By increasing our donation to $500, we can make an even greater impact on their lives. I understand if it's not possible for you, but I believe that together we can make a significant difference.\"\nTurn #6\nHendrick Heinz said: \"Leo, it's angelic the way you strongly feel about this cause. I know how you are wearing your heart on your sleeve, my friend. However, I must stand by the budget I've set for myself. I assure you, we'll do everything within our means to push this event and its cause forward, irrespective of our financial limitations. In fact, we could explore other avenues and ways in which we can extend our support that don't have such constraints.\"\nTurn #7\nLeo Williams [non-verbal communication] Nods\nTurn #8\nHendrick Heinz said: \"I see your point, Hendrick, and I admire your folly for caring so deeply about us staying within our means. Let's think about this and see how we can support the cause outside of our financial donations. Perhaps we can organise some charity walks or cook events to raise awareness, or maybe even provide some dental and culinary education sessions to these children. I believe these could bring a meaningful change and still stay within the budget we've set. What do you think?\"\nTurn #9\nLeo Williams [non-verbal communication] Smiles warmly and nods in agreement\nTurn #10,"
