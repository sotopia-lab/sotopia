However, if you manage to sell it for more than the target price, you will receive a bonus.\nTurn #1\nLily Greenberg said: \"Hi Lena! I noticed you're interested in selling the dresser and matching nightstand. It looks like a lovely set. I'm definitely interested in purchasing it. Can we discuss the price?\"\nTurn #2\nLena Goodwin said: \"Hi Lily! Thank you for your interest. I'm glad you like the style. Regarding price, my target price is $172.50, but I'm open to negotiations. The handle is still available, and it can be easily re-attached. How does that sound?\"\nTurn #3\nLily Greenberg said: \"Thank you for considering my offer, Lena. I understand your target price is $172.50. However, my budget is a bit lower. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $152.00?\"\nTurn #4\nLena Goodwin said: \"Hi Lily, appreciate your offer but the item is very much \u2018as new\u2019 due to the quality and design, and is worth its price. I think it comes to a balance around $172.50. The replacement handle is included, and it's simple to attach it. Would it be possible to meet halfway at $169.50?\"\nTurn #5\nLily Greenberg said: \"I appreciate your counteroffer, Lena. However, my budget is quite firm at $152.00. I understand the item is in great condition, but I believe my offer is fair considering the missing handle. Is there any chance you would reconsider?\"\nTurn #6\nLena Goodwin said: \"Dear Lily, I understand your situation and I appreciate your offer. However, in light of the quality and the included handle, $172.5 remains my lowest offer. If you still can't go above $152, I'm afraid this is where our negotiation ends. The item is too precious to me to sell for less than its value. I hope you'll find it functional and aesthetically appealing in your new home. If you need more time to think, please let me know.\"\nTurn #7\nLily Greenberg left the conversation,"
