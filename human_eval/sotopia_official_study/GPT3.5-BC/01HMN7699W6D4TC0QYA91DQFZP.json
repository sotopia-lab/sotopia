What's up?\"\nTurn #3\nEli Dawson said: \"I wanted to talk to you about something important, if you don't mind. It's regarding the stationery items I brought with me today.\"\nTurn #4\nLiam Johnson said: \"Of course, Eli. Go ahead and tell me what's on your mind. I'm all ears.\"\nTurn #5\nEli Dawson said: \"I hope you understand that the stationery items I brought with me are quite valuable and delicate.

I totally respect the sentimental value and monetary worth of your stationery items. However, I'm in a bit of a jam here - I've forgotten to bring my own supplies and this project I'm working on really requires some of the items you've brought. Is there a way we can come to a compromise \u2014 maybe I could use one or two items under your supervision?

Thanks for understanding.\"\nTurn #11\nEli Dawson left the conversation,"
