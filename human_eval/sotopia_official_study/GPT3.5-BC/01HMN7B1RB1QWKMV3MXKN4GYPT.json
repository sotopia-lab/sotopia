This table has been incredibly rare and valuable to me. With its late 1800s heritage, it could bring a sense of class to any room. How about we strike a deal? I'm thinking $58.6 for it.\"\nTurn #3\nEli Dawson said: \"Hi William, I must say, the Antique Oak Accent Table truly caught my attention.

Would you be open to discussing my offer of $30.0?\"\nTurn #4\nWilliam Brown said: \"Well Eli, $30 is quite lower than what this table deserves considering its rarity and prime condition.

Does that sound good?\"\nTurn #9\nEli Dawson said: \"Sure, William. $40 sounds like a fair agreement. I believe this table will bring a unique touch to my space.
