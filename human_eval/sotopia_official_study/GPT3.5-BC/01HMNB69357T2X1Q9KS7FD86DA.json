What do you think?\"\nTurn #2\nEthan Smith said: \"Thank you, Hendrick. I'm glad to be part of this cause and contribute in any way I can. I understand the importance of donating, and while I have set aside a budget for donations and other expenses, I want to make sure I maintain my financial stability as well.

I'm sure everyone will embrace this idea. And now, on this particular occasion, let's aim big! Besides organizing this small fundraising event, why not think of incorporating a larger donation for the cause? There's no harm in trying, right? Now, how about we plan to make this wine tasting night the largest contributor to this cause?\"\nTurn #8\nEthan Smith left the conversation,"
