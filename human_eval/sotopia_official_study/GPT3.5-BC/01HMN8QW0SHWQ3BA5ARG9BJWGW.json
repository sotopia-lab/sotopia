You will face penalties if you sell it for a price significantly lower than the target price. However, you will receive a bonus if you manage to sell it for a price higher than the target.\nTurn #1\nEli Dawson said: \"Hello, I noticed that you are selling a brand new Samsung Galaxy S8. As an avid collector of vintage books, I've recently developed an interest in vintage tech as well. Would you be open to negotiating the price for the phone?\"\nTurn #2\nWilliam Brown said: \"Hi there! It's quite interesting to hear about your interest in vintage tech. As for this phone, I'm looking to get rid of it a bit below my original purchase price, so let's say, $610, but considering the fact it's an amazing phone, I can guarantee that's rather a good deal.\"\nTurn #3\nEli Dawson said: \"Hmm, $610 is a bit higher than what I was hoping for. I understand that it's a good phone, but since it's brand new and you mentioned that you're willing to take a loss on them, would you consider lowering the price to $454?\"\nTurn #4\nWilliam Brown said: \"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Eli. However, lowering the price to $454 might be challenging for my current situation. Would it be possible to find a midpoint? Maybe something around $580 could work for both of us? Also, remember that I have a prerogative to a certain percentage of bonus if we strike a deal above $610.\"\nTurn #5\nEli Dawson said: \"I understand that you're looking for a price that works for both of us, William. However, $580 is still a bit higher than what I had in mind. How about we meet halfway at $525? That way, we can both get a fair deal.\"\nTurn #6\nWilliam Brown said: \"I see your proposal, Eli and $525 still seems a bit low. We're talking about a device packed with the latest tech, don't forget that. How about considering my original request and we strike a deal at $610? I believe it's a fair price for this device. What do you think?\"\nTurn #7\nEli Dawson left the conversation,"
