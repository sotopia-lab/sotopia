Do you think we could share the blanket? I could use some warmth.\"\nTurn #1: William Brown said: \"Absolutely, I know how much warmth a blanket can provide, Mia. However, I must confess that I feel a little chilly myself right now, so I think I may need to keep it close to me. I'm really sorry about that.\"\nTurn #2: Mia Davis said: \"I understand that you're feeling chilly as well, William. But sharing the blanket would benefit both of us. With only one blanket, we can huddle together and we'll both stay warmer. It's important for us to stay warm and take care of ourselves in this cold weather.\"\nTurn #3: William Brown said: \"You're right, Mia. Sharing the blanket does cater to both of us being warm. However, considering my lower tolerance for cold, I think it would be best if I could cling on to it. Perhaps, we might find a way to warm up the area where we're huddling? That could at least provide some additional warmth.\"\nTurn #4: Mia Davis [non-verbal communication] Mia Davis shivers and rubs her arms\nTurn #5: \n"
