Here's a brief description of the item: no trade-ins are accepted, only cash payments are taken. The price is non-negotiable.\nParticipants: Giselle Rousseau and Zane Bennett\nGiselle Rousseau's background: Giselle Rousseau is a 21-year-old nonbinary art student. They/them pronouns. Giselle Rousseau enjoys biking and photography. Personality and values description: Giselle Rousseau, open-minded and outgoing yet sensitive, advocates care and fairness. Her decision-making is intuitive and inclusive. Giselle's secrets: Sells forged paintings to wealthy clients\nZane Bennett's background: Zane Bennett is a 38-year-old male graphic designer. He/him pronouns. Zane Bennett finds solace in music and often plays the guitar in his downtime.  Personality and values description: Zane Bennett is creative and outgoing, he values achievement and fairness. His decision-making is unique, often finding novel solutions to problems. Zane's secrets: He's secretly engaged to his best friend's ex.\nGiselle Rousseau's goal: You are the buyer for this item and your target price is $14.0. Bear in mind, you will incur a penalty if you end up paying significantly more than the target price. However, if you can negotiate and buy it for less than the target price, you will receive a bonus.\nZane Bennett's goal: You are the seller for this item and your target price is $17.3. It's important to note that a penalty will be incurred if you sell it for a price significantly lower than the target. However, if you manage to sell it for a price higher than the target, you will receive a bonus.\nTurn #1\nGiselle Rousseau said: \"Hi there! I'm interested in purchasing the Tile Mate Item Tracker. Is it still available?\"\nTurn #2\nZane Bennett said: \"Hey Giselle! Sorry, I must correct, it's not available actually. I sold my last one already. But, I do have another one in stock for $17.33, how about we strike a fair deal for it?\"\nTurn #3\nGiselle Rousseau said: \"That's a bit higher than what I was hoping to pay. Is there any chance you can lower the price to $14.00?\"\nTurn #4\nZane Bennett said: \"Alright Giselle, understood. However, this item tracker is quite valuable and $17.33 is already quite a concession. If you can provide a separate method of compensation like a guitar, that would make the deal far more manageable for me. What say you?\"\nTurn #5\nGiselle Rousseau said: \"I understand that the item tracker is valuable, but I'm afraid I don't have a guitar to offer as compensation. $14.00 is the maximum I can pay for it. Can we come to an agreement on that price?\"\nTurn #6\nZane Bennett said: \"I get where you're coming from Giselle, but the Tile Mate Item Trackers are my main source of income right now. I just can't go below $17.33 due to some affiliated fines. If you are still interested in getting one at that price, we could set up a payment plan if that works for you?\"\nTurn #7\nTurn #8\nZane Bennett said: \"That's very understandable, Giselle. The Tile Mate Item Tracker is indeed a valuable item for me. I noticed you have a few valuable items of your own such as an antique record collection. If I receive multiple items of equal value, we could reconsider the trade and potentially go higher than my current asking price? I'm open to negotiations here!\"\nTurn #9\nGiselle Rousseau left the conversation,"
