However, I would also like to have at least one hat for myself. How about we each take one hat for now?\"\nTurn #3\nSophia James said: \"The hats are your favorite, can we take them all?\"\nTurn #4\nMiles Hawkins said: \"Sophia, I understand that the hats are your favorite and I want you to be happy.

I can give you one ball from the pair, and you can keep the 2 other balls and the book if you'd like.\"\nTurn #16\nMiles Hawkins said: \"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Sophia. However, I still believe that splitting the items based on their partial value would be the fairest option. Since the book is worth 3 points and the balls are worth 2 points each, how about we each take one ball and the book, and then decide together who gets the third ball? That way, we both get something we value.\"\nTurn #17\nTurn #18\nMiles Hawkins said: \"I understand that you value the weight of the items, Sophia. However, I still believe that splitting the items based on their partial value would be the fairest option.
