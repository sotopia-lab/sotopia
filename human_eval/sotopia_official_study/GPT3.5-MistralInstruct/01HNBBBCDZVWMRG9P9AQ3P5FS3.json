How about we share the blanket? It'll help keep us both warm and cozy.\"\nTurn #2\nMicah Stevens said: \"I appreciate the offer Naomi, but I'm already pretty cold and I could use the blanket for myself. Thanks anyways!\"\nTurn #3\nNaomi Fletcher said: \"I understand that you're cold, Micah, but I'm really freezing too. Sharing the blanket would be the best way for both of us to stay warm. We can alternate it during the night so that we both get a chance to benefit from it. What do you think?\"\nTurn #4\nMicah Stevens [non-verbal communication] a shiver\nTurn #5\nNaomi Fletcher said: \"I can see that you're cold, Micah. But I'm really struggling to keep warm here.

Let's roll off in opposite directions and make sure to leave our blankets behind for the other person to find. This way, we both get to have a blanket for ourselves. What do you think? We can set ourselves a 15 minute timer, that way we can switch after 15 minutes. What do you say?\"\nTurn #7\nNaomi Fletcher [non-verbal communication] shivering\nTurn #8\nMicah Stevens said: \"Naomi, I just realized that I need to keep my blanket for myself.

I don't want you to catch a cold!\"\nTurn #11\nNaomi Fletcher said: \"Micah, I understand that you want to keep the blanket for yourself, but I'm really struggling with the cold. It would mean a lot to me if you could share the blanket with me tonight. We can switch every 15 minutes so that we both get a chance to stay warm. What do you say?\"\nTurn #12\nMicah Stevens said: \"Thank you so much for your generous offer, Naomi. While I appreciate your caveat, I still would like to keep the blanket for myself as I need it more than you do. However, I will make sure to keep an eye on the temperature throughout the night and try to let go if I get too warm.\"\nTurn #13\nNaomi Fletcher left the conversation,"
