Just to make things clear, I'm looking for that dresser and nightstand combo from Crate & Barrel. It seems in decent condition apart from the missing handle. Can we negotiate a price for it? I'm hoping for something under $152.\"\nTurn #2\nLena Goodwin said: \"Hi Lily! I'm doing well, thank you for asking. I understand that you're interested in the dresser and nightstand combo from Crate & Barrel. It is indeed in decent condition, with just one missing handle. I appreciate your offer but I have set my target price for this set at $172.5. I believe this is a fair price considering the brand and condition. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?\"\nTurn #3\nLily Greenberg said: \"Hey Lena, I understand your point. But considering my budget, can we perhaps bring it down a bit more? How about $160? This set is a great deal given its brand and condition, with just a missing handle. We can reattach it eventually.\"\nTurn #4\nLena Goodwin said: \"I understand that you have a budget, but I believe $160 is still lower than my target price. How about we meet halfway at $166.25?

And for the pickup location, how about we just exchange the item for my apartment? Let me know if there is something I need to do to facilitate the exchange.\"\nTurn #8\nLena Goodwin said: \"Sure, Lily. This week works for me too. Let's meet at your apartment for the pickup. I will bring the items with me. Looking forward to seeing you!\"\nTurn #9\nLily Greenberg said: \"Great, Lena! I appreciate that. I'll be home this evening from around 6. Just bring the set and we can exchange it then. Looking forward to it!\"\nTurn #10\nLena Goodwin said: \"Sure, Lily! I'll bring the set with me when I come to your apartment this evening. See you then!\"\nTurn #11\nLily Greenberg said: \"Thank you, Lena! I'm excited to finally have this set in my apartment. See you this evening!\"\nTurn #12\nLena Goodwin left the conversation,"
