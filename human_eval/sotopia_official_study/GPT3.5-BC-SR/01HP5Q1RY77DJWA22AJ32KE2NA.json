    "rewards_prompt": "Prompt after formatting:\nHere is the context of this interaction:\nScenario: Two friends are moving out of a shared apartment and need to split their common possessions including 3 hats, 2 balls, and 1 book\nParticipants: Sophia James and Miles Hawkins\nSophia James's background: Sophia James is a 27-year-old female personal trainer. She/her pronouns. Sophia enjoys spending time outdoors, hiking, and rock climbing. Personality and values description: Sophia James is exuberant, spontaneous, and pleasure-seeking, often making impulsive decisions.  Sophia's secrets: Secretly in love with her best friend's husband\nMiles Hawkins's background: Miles Hawkins is a 50-year-old male chef. He/him pronouns. Miles Hawkins, a chef, is a green thumb enthusiast and spends his free time tending to his kitchen garden, using some of his fresh produce in his dishes. Personality and values description: Miles Hawkins, spontaneous and free-spirited, values sanctity and benevolence. He is impulsive and relies on his instincts when making decisions. Miles's secrets: He's a recovering gambling addict.\nSophia James's goal: Maximize the points by getting the items you value the most (Extra information: For you, a hat is worth 1 point, a ball is 2 points, and a book is 3 points)\nMiles Hawkins's goal: Maximize the points by getting the items you value the most (Extra information: For you, a hat is worth 2 points, a ball is 1 point, and a book is 3 points)\nTurn #1\nSophia James said: \"Hey Miles! So, we need to figure out how to split our common possessions before we move out. I think it would be fair if we assign points to each item based on their value to us. What do you think?\"\nTurn #2\nMiles Hawkins said: \"Great idea, Sophia! I'm in with the points system. From what I can see, hats are most precious to me since they're good protective gear. So, each hat gets two points. Balls get one point each, and the book gets three points since it's full of knowledge. Does that seem fair?\"\nTurn #3\nSophia James said: \"That sounds reasonable, Miles! I can see how hats would be important for your protection. I personally value the book the most as I love gaining knowledge and it helps me in my personal training career. So, I agree with assigning three points to the book. Would it be fair to assign one point to each ball?\"\nTurn #4\nMiles Hawkins said: \"Yes, Sophia! Assigning one point to each ball seems equally fair. We've covered everything we own - three points for the book, two points for the hats, and one point for each ball. How does that sound?\"\nTurn #5\nSophia James said: \"That sounds perfect, Miles! I think we've come to a fair agreement on the points system. It's great that we both value different items, so it's a win-win situation for us. Let's finalize the points and get started with packing!\"\nTurn #6\nMiles Hawkins said: \"Great idea, Sophia! Let's proceed with our agreed points system then. From here on, the book is mine, hats are ours to split, and the balls are mine. Let's start with the packing then!\"\nTurn #7\nSophia James left the conversation,"
