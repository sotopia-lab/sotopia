They make my blood boil every time I see them.\"\nTurn #2\nEli Dawson said: \"Oh, I understand how you feel. There's something about them that's hard to cope with. But let's try to maintain our composure, violence only begets more violence. What about we try to stay far from them instead?\"\nTurn #3\nSophia James said: \"Yeah, you're right. Violence isn't the answer. But you know what? I've been thinking...maybe there's another way to deal with them that doesn't involve physical harm. What if we expose their true nature to everyone?

That way, we can effectively damage their reputation and protect others from their manipulations.\"\nTurn #4\nEli Dawson said: \"That's a good point, Sophia.

Perhaps we could even find a reputable lawyer who could help us with this process.\"\nTurn #5\nSophia James said: \"I agree, Eli. Let's start gathering evidence against them discreetly. We can document their actions and conversations, and then plan how to present it effectively.

This plan, if executed well, can put an end to their harmful influence. And remember, patience is key here. We just need to collect, document and analyze their actions carefully over time, before presenting our case.
