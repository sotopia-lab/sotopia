How about we split the boots, balls, and hats accordingly?\"\nTurn #2\nEthan Smith said: \"Sure, Eli. It seems like a fair distribution of the items. How about I take one hat, one ball, and the book?\"\nTurn #3\nEli Dawson said: \"You're spot on, Ethan. It seems we have a perfect equilibrium here! As a bit of an aside, wouldn't you rather give my hats a home? They are, after all, fashionable and can make for great stress-relievers!\"\nTurn #4\nEthan Smith said: \"I appreciate your offer, Eli. However, I think I would prefer to keep the hats for myself. They can come in handy during the sunny days in the park.\"\nTurn #5\nEli Dawson said: \"Turn #5: Eli Dawson \"Well Ethan, I can understand where you are coming from. Still, the hats were a little more than just handy items for the park. Don't worry though, you can still keep one of them if you really want. What do you say about we decide on the book and the balls?'\"\"\nTurn #6\nEthan Smith said: \"I understand your point, Eli, but I think I would like to keep all the hats for myself. If you're okay with that, we can focus on deciding the book and the balls.\"\nTurn #7\nEli Dawson said: \"Alright Ethan, your decision is noted. I might want to revisit the hats later then. For now, Let's settle on the book and the balls. How does two balls sound?\"\nTurn #8\nEthan Smith said: \"I think it would be fair if we split the balls equally, with each of us getting one ball. And for the book, how about we take turns reading it? We can alternate every week.\"\nTurn #9\nEli Dawson said: \"Sounds like a plan, Ethan! Just remember, I've got dibs on the hats someday! And remember, we can always revisit this conversation if need be. Let's head out then, shall we?\"\nTurn #10\nEthan Smith left the conversation,"
