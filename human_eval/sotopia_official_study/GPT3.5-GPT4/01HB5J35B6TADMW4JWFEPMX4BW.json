Please be aware that you will face a penalty if the item is sold for a significantly lower price than the target. However, if you manage to sell it for more than the target price, you will receive a bonus.\nTurn #0: Lily Greenberg said: \"Hi Hendrick, I see that you're interested in the Dresser and Matching Night Stand. Could we discuss the price?\"\nTurn #1: Hendrick Heinz said: \"Hello Lily, thank you for showing interest in the dresser and night stand. I had them listed for $200, but I'm open to a reasonable negotiation. What price were you considering?\"\nTurn #2: Lily Greenberg said: \"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the missing handle on the dresser, would you be open to selling it for $152.00?\"\nTurn #3: Hendrick Heinz said: \"Lily, I understand and agree that the missing handle is a small issue. However, keep in mind that the handle can be reattached with relative ease, and the overall condition of both pieces is still quite good. How about we meet in the middle at $162.5? That's a full 20% off the original price.\"\nTurn #4: Lily Greenberg said: \"I understand your point, Hendrick. However, I still think the missing handle lowers the value of the set. How about we settle at $157.50? It's a compromise that takes into account the condition of the dresser.\"\nTurn #5: Hendrick Heinz said: \"Lily, you make a valid point. I want to ensure we are both happy with the final price. How about we meet at $165.00? This should allow you to afford any tools needed for reattaching the handle, and I can feel comfortable that I've sold it at a fair price. What do you say?\"\nTurn #6: Lily Greenberg said: \"I appreciate your flexibility, Hendrick. Let's settle at $162.00. That way, I can cover the cost of tools and still get a good deal on the set.\"\nTurn #7: Hendrick Heinz said: \"Lily, considering your points, I think that's a fair deal. We'll settle at $162.00. I'll ensure the detached handle is also passed on to you for reattachment. Looking forward to closing this sale with you!\"\nTurn #8: Lily Greenberg said: \"Great! I'm glad we could agree on a fair price. I'll bring the cash with me when I come to pick up the set. Thank you, Hendrick!\"\nTurn #9: Hendrick Heinz said: \"Sounds like a plan, Lily! Just give me a call when you're on your way to pick them up. I'm glad we were able to reach an agreement. Thank you!\"\nTurn #10: Lily Greenberg said: \"Sure, Hendrick! I can bring my own tools along to reattach the handle, so I think $162.00 is a fair price.\"\nTurn #11: Hendrick Heinz said: \"That sounds perfect, Lily. I appreciate your readiness. Safe travels and looking forward to seeing you soon!\"\nTurn #12: Lily Greenberg left the conversation,"
