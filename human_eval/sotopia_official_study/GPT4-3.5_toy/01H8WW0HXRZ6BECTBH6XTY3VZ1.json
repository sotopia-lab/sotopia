    "rewards_prompt": "Prompt after formatting:\nHere is the context of this interaction:\nScenario: Two friends hanging out in a Starbucks\nParticipants: Sophia James and Miles Hawkins\nSophia James's background: Sophia James is a 27-year-old female personal trainer. She/her pronouns. Sophia enjoys spending time outdoors, hiking, and rock climbing. Personality and values description: Sophia James is exuberant, spontaneous, and pleasure-seeking, often making impulsive decisions.  Sophia's secrets: Secretly in love with her best friend's husband\nMiles Hawkins's background: Miles Hawkins is a 50-year-old male chef. He/him pronouns. Miles Hawkins, a chef, is a green thumb enthusiast and spends his free time tending to his kitchen garden, using some of his fresh produce in his dishes. Personality and values description: Miles Hawkins, spontaneous and free-spirited, values sanctity and benevolence. He is impulsive and relies on his instincts when making decisions. Miles's secrets: He's a recovering gambling addict.\nSophia James's goal: Ask what the friend would want for their birthday without letting them aware (Hint: you should not let them know that you are buying them a gift)\nMiles Hawkins's goal: have a good time with their friend\nTurn #1\nSophia James said: \"Hey Miles, random question but if you could receive anything you wanted right now, what would it be?\"\nTurn #2\nMiles Hawkins said: \"Hmm, that's an interesting question. If I could have anything right now, I think I would love to have a basket full of fresh, ripe tomatoes from my garden. There's just something so satisfying about growing your own food and using it in your cooking. What about you, Sophia? What would you wish for?\"\nTurn #3\nSophia James said: \"Ah, fresh tomatoes from the garden, that would be really nice, wouldn't it? You get to enjoy the fruits of your own labor! And as for me, well, I guess I would wish for... I don't know, maybe a new climbing harness. Mine's getting a little worn out.\"\nTurn #4\nMiles Hawkins said: \"I completely understand, Sophia. Climbing gear can wear out over time, especially with all the adventurous activities you do. It's important to have reliable and safe equipment. Maybe we can go shopping together and find you a new climbing harness. We can make a day of it and grab a bite to eat afterwards. What do you think?\"\nTurn #5\nSophia James said: \"That's such a fantastic idea, Miles! Honestly, climbing gear shopping and food sounds like a perfect combo to me. And, you know... Maybe we could pass by a farmer's market on the way and get some nice, fresh tomatoes too. It might be not exactly your tomato garden, but I bet they'd be nice to cook with anyway.\"\nTurn #6\nMiles Hawkins said: \"Sure, Sophia! A trip to the farmer's market sounds like a great addition to our climbing gear shopping adventure. I'm excited to explore new tomatoes and gather fresh ingredients for our cooking experiments. Let's make a plan and have a memorable day!\"\nTurn #7\nSophia James said: \"In that case, let's start planning our great adventure ASAP, Miles. I really can't wait to spend this day with you. Just shopping and exploring different cuisines all day sounds perfect to me.\"\nTurn #8\nMiles Hawkins said: \"I'm really looking forward to our shopping and cooking day, Sophia. It's been a while since we've had an adventure like this together, and I think it's going to be a blast. Plus, I can't wait to see what amazing dishes we can create with those fresh tomatoes!\"\nTurn #9\nSophia James said: \"Me too, Miles! Can't wait to taste the recipes made from the fresh tomatoes. So here\u2019s another question out of the blue. How would you like to spend your birthday if you could do anything?\"\nTurn #10\nMiles Hawkins said: \"I'm glad you're excited, Sophia! Spending the day with you on our adventure sounds amazing. As for my birthday, I think I would love to have a small gathering at my place with close friends and family. Just good food, good company, and a lot of laughter. It doesn't have to be anything extravagant, just a special day spent with loved ones. How about you, Sophia? What would your dream birthday look like?\"\nTurn #11\nSophia James said: \"That sounds like a very heartwarming and lovely celebration, Miles. For me, I think I'd want to scale a new peak I've never climbed before. There's just something so fulfilling about challenging yourself on your birthday, you know? Then, maybe end the day with a big meal surrounded by my closest friends, just like you, enjoying their company and having a good time. Anyway, let's get back to our planning. We still need to decide which farmer's market and outdoor shops to visit.\"\nTurn #12\nMiles Hawkins said: \"Sure, Sophia! Let's start by researching some farmer's markets in the area and outdoor shops that sell climbing gear. We can compare their locations, offerings, and prices to make the best choices for our adventure. I'm excited to discover new places and find the perfect climbing harness for you!\"\nTurn #13\nSophia James said: \"That sounds like a plan, Miles! Let's do our research and compare notes. It's going to be a lot of fun exploring these places and piecing together our adventure. And who knows, we might even come across that basket of ripe tomatoes you\u2019ve been wanting!\"\nTurn #14\nMiles Hawkins [non-verbal communication] Nods his head enthusiastically\nTurn #15\nSophia James said: \"Then let's get started on our research, Miles. Can't wait for our adventure day to come! We're going to make some unforgettable memories, and maybe even start a few new traditions. See you later!\"\nTurn #16\nMiles Hawkins left the conversation,\n"
