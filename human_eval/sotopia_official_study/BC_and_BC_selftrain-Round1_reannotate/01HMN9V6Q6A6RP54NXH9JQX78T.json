However, my budget isn't quite at $20. Do you think we might find a middle ground? Let's say $17? It's like a 3% discount, and I'm an avid gamer as well. If I trade you a rare code for a recent game I really enjoyed, could we work out a deal there?\"\nTurn #8\nBenjamin Jackson said: \"I understand that you have a budget and are interested in getting a better deal. While I can't go as low as $17, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $18. Considering the item's value and the market demand, I believe this is a fair price. What do you think?\"\nTurn #9\nDonovan Reeves said: \"Fair enough, Ben. I understand where you're coming from, let's do $18 then. And I'm pretty sure the game code I'm offering is quite valuable. Thank you for the conversation and, hopefully, we might revisit this at a later time!\"\nTurn #10,"
