That dresser from Crate & Barrel looks like a fine piece. Can we discuss the price a little? It is a great piece, but it has a single missing handle. If it were in perfect condition, I wouldn\u2019t mind paying more, but the discount seems a bit unnecessary here. I have come across this set a few times before and, honestly, even in this condition, I think it is an important part of good furniture, but the money should match its worth. How about $152?'\"\nTurn #2\nGwen Pierce said: \"'Hello Finnegan! I'm happy to hear that you're interested in the dresser and nightstand set. I understand your concern about the missing handle and its impact on the value. While the missing handle does affect the set's condition, it can still be functional and serve its purpose. Considering its overall condition and the original price of a new set, I think $172.5 is a fair price for both parties. What do you think?'\"\nTurn #3\nFinnegan O'Malley said: \"Gwen, I appreciate your understanding and respect for the item's practical usage, despite the missing handle. However, I'm still feeling that $172.5 is a bit more than what it seems to be worth, given its current state. I believe $152 is still a fair price for this piece of furniture, don't you think?\"\nTurn #4\nGwen Pierce left the conversation,"
