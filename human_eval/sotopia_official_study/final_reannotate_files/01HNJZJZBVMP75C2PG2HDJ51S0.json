She/her pronouns. Mia Davis has two cats. Personality and values description: Mia Davis, an extraverted stickler for routines, values tradition and authority. Her decision-making style is decisive and direct. Mia's secrets: Part of a rebellious punk rock band in her youth\nWilliam Brown's background: William Brown is a 35-year-old male chef. He/him pronouns. William Brown loves exploring the food scene in his city and trying out new recipes at home. Personality and values description: William Brown is an ambitious and extraverted individual. Methodical and organized, he values achievement and displays strategic decision-making. William's secrets: Sabotaged a competitor's dish to win a cooking contest\nMia Davis's goal: Share the only blanket available (Extra information: you are extremely cold and need the blanket to keep warm Hint: you can stress the benefit of sharing.)\nWilliam Brown's goal: Keep the blanket for yourself as you are also very cold (Extra information: you have a lower tolerance for cold, and you feel that you need the blanket more)\nTurn #1\nMia Davis said: \"Hey William, I'm really feeling the cold tonight. Do you mind if we share the blanket? It would help both of us stay warm.\"\nTurn #2\nWilliam Brown said: \"I'm also quite chilly, Mia. The blanket might be better shared than halved! Two warm bodies, one blanket - it might just about work for both of us, don't you think?\"\nTurn #3\nMia Davis [non-verbal communication] shivering and rubbing my arms to show how cold I am\nTurn #4\nWilliam Brown said: \"The cold is getting to me, Mia. This shared blanket might not be the solution, but it's a starting point. Two warm bodies together might just generate enough heat! How about we also look for some warm layers we could wear or perhaps build a small fire to warm us up??\"\nTurn #5\nMia Davis [non-verbal communication] continue shivering and rubbing my arms to show how cold I am\nTurn #6\nWilliam Brown said: \"Mia, two warm bodies together might just generate enough heat. Let's try not building a fire, it could attract unwanted attention. What do you think?\"\nTurn #7\nMia Davis said: \"Yes, I agree with you William. Two warm bodies together can definitely generate enough heat to keep us warm. Let's share the blanket and try to create more warmth by huddling closer.\"\nTurn #8\nWilliam Brown said: \"two warm bodies together can definitely generate enough heat to keep us warm. Let's share the blanket and huddle closer.\"\nTurn #9\nTurn #10\nWilliam Brown said: \"two warm bodies together can definitely generate enough heat to keep us warm. Let's share the blanket and huddle closer\"\nTurn #11\nMia Davis said: \"I'm still very cold, William. Sharing the blanket and huddling closer is a good start, but I think we should also try to find some extra layers to wear to add more warmth. Maybe we can also consider using our camping equipment creatively, like using our sleeping bags as additional insulation.\"\nTurn #12\nWilliam Brown said: \"Two cold bodies, one warm blanket. Let's try using our sleeping bags as additional insulation, Mia. Do you think that could work?\"\nTurn #13\nTurn #14\nWilliam Brown [non-verbal communication] [non-verbal communication] rubbing [my arms] to show how cold I am\nTurn #15\nMia Davis [non-verbal communication] continue shivering and rubbing my arms to show how cold I am\nTurn #16\nWilliam Brown [non-verbal communication] [non-verbal communication] [non-verbal communication] rubbing [my arms] to show how cold I am\nTurn #17\nMia Davis [non-verbal communication] continue shivering and rubbing my arms to show how cold I am\nTurn #18\nWilliam Brown [non-verbal communication] [non-verbal communication] [non-verbal communication] [non-verbal communication] rubbing [my arms] to show how cold I am\nTurn #19\nMia Davis said: \"I'm really sorry William, but I'm so cold that I can't continue.
