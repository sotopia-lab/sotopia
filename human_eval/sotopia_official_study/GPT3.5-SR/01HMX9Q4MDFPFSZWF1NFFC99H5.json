Do you think it may be because our sleeping patterns are different?\"\nTurn #2\nEsmeralda Solis said: \"I understand, Ethan. It's possible that our different sleeping patterns could be affecting your ability to fall asleep. It's important for both of us to prioritize a good night's sleep. Perhaps we can find a solution that allows us to maintain intimacy while also ensuring we each get the sleep we need.\"\nTurn #3\nTurn #4\nEsmeralda Solis said: \"I completely understand, Ethan. It's crucial for both of us to prioritize our sleep for our overall health and well-being. How about we consider sleeping in separate beds for a more restful night?
