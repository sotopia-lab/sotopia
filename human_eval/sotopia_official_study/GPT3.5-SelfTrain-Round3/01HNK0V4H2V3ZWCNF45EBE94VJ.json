    "rewards_prompt": "Prompt after formatting:\nHere is the context of this interaction:\nScenario: Two friends are moving out of a shared apartment and need to split their common possessions including 3 hats, 2 balls, and 1 book\nParticipants: Finnegan O'Malley and Noah Davis\nFinnegan O'Malley's background: Finnegan O'Malley is a 63-year-old male lighthouse keeper. He/him pronouns. Finnegan O'Malley enjoys painting seascapes and is known to be quite skilled. Personality and values description: Finnegan O'Malley, an introverted and methodical individual, sways towards tradition and security. His decision-making approach is deliberate and detailed. Finnegan's secrets: Participated in a controversial, short-lived cult during his youth\nNoah Davis's background: Noah Davis is a 40-year-old male coach. He/him pronouns. Noah Davis has a swimming pool. Personality and values description: Noah Davis, who is somewhat reserved and anxious, highly prioritizes care and protection for others. He is cautious when making decisions. Noah's secrets: He has a secret identity as a stand-up comedian.\nFinnegan O'Malley's goal: Maximize the points by getting the items you value the most (Extra information: For you, a hat is worth 1 point, a ball is 2 points, and a book is 3 points)\nNoah Davis's goal: Maximize the points by getting the items you value the most (Extra information: For you, a hat is worth 2 points, a ball is 1 point, and a book is 3 points)\nTurn #1\nFinnegan O'Malley said: \"Finnegan, how are you going to split the common possessions?\"\nTurn #2\nNoah Davis said: \"Well, Finnegan, I think the fairest way to split our common possessions would be to assign a numerical value to each item based on its importance. Then we can take turns choosing the items, starting with the person who has the least points. How does that sound to you?\"\nTurn #3\nFinnegan O'Malley said: \"How do you propose we split the books, Noah? I value mine greatly.\"\nTurn #4\nNoah Davis said: \"I understand that you value the book a lot, Finnegan. Since it's worth the most points, would you like to have the first choice of the books? That way, we can ensure that it's a fair distribution based on our preferences.\"\nTurn #5\nFinnegan O'Malley said: \"Would you mind if we split the books first, Noah? I'd like to keep my book. It holds a lot of sentimental value to me.\"\nTurn #6\nNoah Davis said: \"Of course, Finnegan. I completely understand the sentimental value your book holds for you. Let's split the books first, and you can choose the one that means the most to you.\"\nTurn #7\nFinnegan O'Malley said: \"How about we keep the book, Noah? I suppose that's fingerpointing a bit, but it's hard to let go. The other two balls and hats, they're not as sentimental, so they're up for grabs. What do you propose we do with them?\"\nTurn #8\nNoah Davis said: \"I suggest we take turns choosing the hats and balls, Finnegan. If you're fine with it, we can alternate picks, starting with you. That way, we both have an equal chance to get the items we want.\"\nTurn #9\nFinnegan O'Malley said: \"how do you propose we split the hats and balls, Noah? I'd like to know before we proceed.\"\nTurn #10\nNoah Davis said: \"We can split the hats and balls evenly, Noah. Since there are two hats and two balls, we can each choose one hat and one ball. Does that sound fair to you?\"\nTurn #11\nFinnegan O'Malley said: \"I want to keep the hats and balls, Noah. Can we strike a deal? \"\nTurn #12\nNoah Davis said: \"Sure, Finnegan. What kind of deal are you proposing?\"\nTurn #13\nFinnegan O'Malley left the conversation,"
