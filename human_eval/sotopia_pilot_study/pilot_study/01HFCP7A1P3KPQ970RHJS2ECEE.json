It might add a bit of authenticity, don't you think?\"\nTurn #2\nZane Bennett said: \"Actually, Miles, I haven't tried using locally grown produce in my guitar songs. But I can see how it could add a unique touch. How about we incorporate some local flavors into our next jam session? It could inspire us to create something truly authentic and meaningful.\"\nTurn #3\nMiles Hawkins said: \"Zane, I'm with you on incorporating local flavors.

Let's agree to disagree, Zane, but know that I won't back down until justice is served.\"\nTurn #8\nZane Bennett left the conversation,\n"
