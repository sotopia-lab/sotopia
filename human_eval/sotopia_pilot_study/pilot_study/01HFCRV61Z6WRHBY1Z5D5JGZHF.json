I need a couple of them for my work requirements. Could we possibly strike a deal?\"\nTurn #2\nBenjamin Jackson said: \"Hi Donovan! Thank you for reaching out about the Samsung Galaxy S8. I'd be happy to work out a deal with you. How many phones are you looking to purchase?\"\nTurn #3\nDonovan Reeves said: \"Great, I need two phones for my work. It would be useful if you could match the following price: $454 for each phone. This is important for my budgeting and work requirements. What do you think?\"\nTurn #4\nBenjamin Jackson said: \"Hi Donovan! I understand that you have budget constraints for your work requirements, but the price you're asking for is lower than what I can offer. However, I can offer you a deal of $610 per phone. This is already a discount from the original price, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the brand new condition of the phones. Let me know if this works for you.\"\nTurn #5\nDonovan Reeves said: \"I understand where you're coming from Benjamin, but $610 is still quite higher than my target price. On the other hand, I really appreciate the discount you're offering on bulk purchase. How about if we meet half way? Can we bring the price down to around $540 per phone?\"\nTurn #6\nBenjamin Jackson said: \"I appreciate your offer, Donovan, but $540 per phone is still lower than what I can go. How about if I meet you halfway and offer these brand new phones to you for $580 each? It's a fair deal considering their original price and the discount I'm already offering for bulk purchase. Let me know if this works for you.\"\nTurn #7\nDonovan Reeves said: \"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Benjamin. However, I'd still like to request that you lower the price a bit more. Let's try $560 per phone, which would still be within my budget. How does that sound?\"\nTurn #8\nBenjamin Jackson said: \"I understand your budget constraints, Donovan, but I'm afraid I can't lower the price to $560 per phone. My target price is $610, and I've already negotiated down to $580 for you. This is the best offer I can make. Let me know if you're interested in proceeding with the purchase at this price.\"\nTurn #9\nDonovan Reeves said: \"I see where you're coming from, Benjamin, but I really need to stick to my budget for this purchase. I'm willing to strike a deal though. Let's say I'll take the phones at $570 per phone, a little bit more than my target, but still within my budget. Does this sound like a deal to you?\"\nTurn #10\nBenjamin Jackson said: \"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Donovan. However, I'm afraid I can't lower the price any further. My target price is $610, and I've already offered a discount for bulk purchase. $580 per phone is the best offer I can make. Let me know if you're interested in proceeding with the purchase at this price.\"\nTurn #11\nDonovan Reeves said: \"Benjamin, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and offer a discount for bulk purchase. However, $580 per phone is still slightly above my target price. Let's say I agree to pay $570 per phone, which I believe is a fair price considering my budget constraints and the discount you're already offering. Will this work for you?\"\nTurn #12\nBenjamin Jackson left the conversation,\n"
