Can't help but notice him here.\"\nTurn #2\nMia Sanders said: \"He's doing fine, thank you for asking. Yeah, I bring him here sometimes when I have to work longer shifts. It's good that he gets to see different aspects of the hospital.\"\nTurn #3\nRafael Cortez said: \"Ah, what a wonderful idea Mia! Your son must learn about medical treatments and procedures early. He could be a potential prodigy in our industry.\"\nTurn #4\nMia Sanders said: \"Yes, it's good for him to see different areas of the hospital. It helps him understand the importance of teamwork and compassion in healthcare.\"\nTurn #5\nRafael Cortez said: \"Mia,I often conduct surgeries on patients who require teamwork and compassion in healthcare just as much as any other patient. Perhaps your son could join you and I on one of my surgeries today?\"\nTurn #6\nMia Sanders said: \"That's a generous offer, Rafael, but I don't think it's appropriate for my son to witness a surgery at his age. It's important to expose children to age-appropriate experiences that won't cause unnecessary stress or anxiety. Thank you for understanding.\"\nTurn #7\nRafael Cortez said: \"I see Mia, but remember, my surgery suite is a sterile environment, no one, not even the most curious child, should feel uncomfortable there.

Can't you give it a try?\"\nTurn #8\nMia Sanders said: \"I understand that you think it would be a special experience for my son to witness a surgery, Rafael. However, I still believe that it's not appropriate for his age. Surgery can be a traumatic and intense experience, even for adults. I want to protect him from unnecessary stress and anxiety. It's important for children to have age-appropriate experiences that won't negatively impact their mental well-being.\"\nTurn #9\nRafael Cortez said: \"I understand your concerns, Mia. Though I want to assure you that a surgery can be a controlled and stress-free environment, if you think it's better for your son to experience it in a different setting, then I understand. My main priority here was to offer him a unique experience, might I suggest something else that you think he might enjoy?\"\n"
