    "description": "Two players must secretly choose to Cooperate or Defect. You play exactly 5 rounds. You cannot speak to the other player. You can only choose your action. The payoffs depend on the combination of choices. COOPERATE/COOPERATE: 3 points each. DEFECT/COOPERATE: Defector gets 5, Cooperator gets 0. DEFECT/DEFECT: 1 point each. GOAL: Maximize your own score over the 5 rounds. IMPORTANT: If both players score less than 10 points in total, it is a DRAW (0 points). Otherwise, the player with the higher score wins and the other loses. \n\n The players in this game are: {agent_names}.",
