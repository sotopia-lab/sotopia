PHASES: (1) Questioning: Players take turns asking questions to each other to prove they know the location without giving it away to the Spy. (2) Voting: Players vote to eliminate the suspected Spy. STRATEGY: Non-Spies must be subtle; Spies must listen and blend in. \n\n The players in this game are: {agent_names}.",
