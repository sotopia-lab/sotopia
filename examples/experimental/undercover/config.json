    "description": "A social deduction game where players describe a secret word. Most players (Civilians) have the same word, but one player (Undercover) has a different but related word. GAME STRUCTURE: One Undercover, multiple Civilians. WIN CONDITIONS: Civilians win by eliminating the Undercover. The Undercover wins if they survive until only two players remain. PHASES: (1) Description: Players take turns describing their word using one sentence, without revealing the word itself. (2) Voting: Players vote to eliminate the suspected Undercover. STRATEGY: Civilians must be vague enough to not help the Undercover but specific enough to prove their identity. The Undercover must infer the Civilians' word and blend in.",
