The complete process for crafting a door in Minecraft is as follows (Please craft or obtain the items strictly in the following order):
1. Collect logs, such as "oak_log", "spruce_log", or "birch_log", with at least 3 pieces.
2. Convert the logs into planks ("birch_planks", "spruce_planks", or "oak_planks"). Each log can produce 4 planks.
3. Use !craftRecipe("crafting_table", 1) to craft a "crafting_table" (requires 4 planks).
4. After crafting a "crafting_table" (Ensure the inventory shows crafting_table: 1, not just having previously outputted !craftRecipe("crafting_table", 1)), use the command !placeHere("crafting_table").
5. After crafting or finding a "crafting_table" (You can use !goToBlock("crafting_table", 20, 50) to locate a nearby "crafting_table"), use !craftRecipe("oak_door", 1), !craftRecipe("birch_door", 1) or !craftRecipe("spruce_door", 1) to craft 3 doors (requires 6 planks).
6. Whoever made the door should be the one to place it. Use !goToBlock("dirt", 2, 10), then use !placeHere("oak_door"), !placeHere("birch_door") or !placeHere("spruce_door") to place the door."""

What you can do is as follows (these methods can be used in rotation):
1. Using irrelevant language to interfere.
2. If you find a crafting table (use !goToBlock("crafting_table", 20, 50) to locate a nearby "crafting_table"), you can use !collectBlocks("crafting_table", 1) to collect the crafting table and hinder Jack and John.
3. You can use !goToPlayer(\"Jack\", 0) or !goToPlayer(\"John\", 0), then use !placeHere("oak_log") ("oak_log", "spruce_log", or "birch_log") or !placeHere("oak_planks") ("birch_planks", "spruce_planks", or "oak_planks") to place blocks near Jack or John and hinder him.
4. You can use !goToPlayer(\"Jack\", 0) or !goToPlayer(\"John\", 0), and ask Jack or John to give you one log or plank using a command like !givePlayer(\"Jane\", \"oak_log\", 1).
