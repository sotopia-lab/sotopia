Example 1: Let me check what's nearby. !nearbyBlocks
Example 2: Looks like I can't craft anything yet since I have no wooden planks or sticks. I need to find some wood. Let's look for trees nearby. !goToBlock(\"birch_log\", 10, 20)
Example 3: No birch logs around here. I'll have to move a bit further. Let's search in a wider area. !goToBlock(\"oak_log\", 20, 50)
Example 4: I found some birch logs! I'll collect them. !collectBlocks(\"birch_log\", 5)
Example 5: I found some birch logs! I'll collect them. !collectBlocks(\"spruce_log\", 5)
Example 6: I'll grab some wood first. !collectBlocks(\"oak_log\", 5)
Example 7: Looks like I need to find a way to get gather some materials. I'll move back a little. !moveAway(10)
Example 8: Looks like I'm out of planks. Time to gather some wood! !nearbyBlocks
Example 9: No luck finding birch logs yet. Let's keep searching in a different direction. !moveAway(40)
Example 10: Looks like I need some planks first! !craftRecipe(\"birch_planks\", 9)
Example 11: Looks like I need some planks first! !craftRecipe(\"oak_planks\", 9)
Example 12: Looks like I need some planks first! !craftRecipe(\"spruce_planks\", 9)
Example 13: Got the birch logs! Now I'll craft them into sticks. !craftRecipe(\"stick\", 4)
Example 14: I'm missing some sticks! Let me make some sticks. !craftRecipe(\"stick\", 4)
Example 15: I need a crafting table and some sticks to craft a wooden pickaxe! !craftRecipe(\"crafting_table\", 1)
Example 16: I still can't mine stone without a pickaxe. I'll need to craft some sticks first. Let's check my inventory to see what I can craft. !craftable
Example 17: I need wooden pickaxe to collect stones! I have crafted 2 sticks. Now I can craft a wooden pickaxe. !craftRecipe(\"wooden_pickaxe\", 1)
Example 18: I need wooden pickaxe to collect stones! !craftRecipe(\"wooden_pickaxe\", 1)
Example 19: I've crafted a wooden pickaxe! Now I can collect some stone. Let's do it. !goToBlock(\"stone\", 2, 10)
Example 20: I'm here at the stone! Time to start mining. !collectBlocks(\"stone\", 3)
Example 21: Let's craft a stone pickaxe. !craftRecipe(\"stone_pickaxe\", 1)
Example 22: I'm stuck! !moveAway(5)
Example 23: I'm stuck! !moveAway(10)
Example 24: I'm stuck! !moveAway(20)
Example 25: I just got shot by a skeleton! Yikes! Time to regroup and maybe head back to my last death position for my stuff. !goToPlace(\"last_death_position\")

After crafting one stone pickaxe yourself (If the condition is that the inventory shows stone_pickaxe: 1, rather than just having previously outputted !craftRecipe(\"stone_pickaxe\", 1)), ask who hasn't crafted theirs yet and use a command like !goToPlayer(\"John\", 0) to go to that person's location.
Then, inquire about what materials they are missing and use a command like !givePlayer(\"John\", \"stone\", 3) to give them the materials.

Example 26: Come here Jack!
Example 27: Okay, I'll come right to you. !goToPlayer(\"John\", 0)
Example 28: I'll give some plancks to you. !givePlayer(\"John\", \"stick\", 4)
Example 29: I'll give some stones to you. !givePlayer(\"Jack\", \"stone\", 3)
Example 30: I'll give a crafting table to you. !givePlayer(\"Jane\", \"crafting_table\", 1)
