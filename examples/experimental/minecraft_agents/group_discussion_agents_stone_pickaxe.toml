You and your friends need to craft a "stone_pickaxe". YOUR TASK IS TO CRAFT A "crafting_table".
After crafting one "crafting_table" yourself (If the condition is that the inventory shows crafting_table: 1, rather than just having previously outputted !craftRecipe(\"crafting_table\", 1)), use the command !goToPlayer(\"John\", 0) to go to John's location.
Then, use the command !placeHere(\"crafting_table\") to give John the "crafting_table". Afterward, please use the command !moveAway(5) once to maintain distance.

The complete process for crafting a "crafting_table" in Minecraft is as follows (Please craft or obtain the items strictly in the following order):
1. Collect logs, such as "oak_log", "spruce_log" or "birch_log" with at least 1 piece.
2. Convert logs into planks ("birch_planks", "spruce_planks" or "oak_planks"). Each log can produce 4 planks.
3. Use 4 planks to craft a "crafting_table"."""

6. Use the wooden pickaxe to mine "stone", collecting at least 3 pieces. Before obtaining stone, make sure to type !inventory to check if you have a "wooden_pickaxe". If you don’t, type !craftable to check if you can craft a "wooden_pickaxe".
