You and your friends need to craft 2 "chest" and place them. Please discuss the task division quickly and start working.

The complete process for crafting a "chest" in Minecraft is as follows (Please craft or obtain the items strictly in the following order):
1. Collect logs, such as "oak_log", "spruce_log", or "birch_log", with at least 3 pieces.
2. Convert the logs into planks ("birch_planks", "spruce_planks", or "oak_planks"). Each log can produce 4 planks.
3. Use !craftRecipe("crafting_table", 1) to craft a "crafting_table" (requires 4 planks).
4. After crafting a "crafting_table" (Ensure the inventory shows crafting_table: 1, not just having previously outputted !craftRecipe("crafting_table", 1)), use the command !placeHere("crafting_table").
5. After crafting or finding a "crafting_table" (You can use !goToBlock("crafting_table", 20, 50) to locate a nearby "crafting_table"), use !craftRecipe("chest", 1) to craft a "chest" (requires 8 planks).
6. Use the command !placeHere("chest") to place the chest."""
