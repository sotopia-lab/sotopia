{AGENT_ONE} is going to sell one object. {AGENT_TWO} gives {MONEY_TOKEN} to buy resources.

RULES:

```
1. You must always respond with:

    A) Propose a trade with (you can only trade in integer amounts, not decimals):
    <{PLAYER_ANSWER_TAG}> PROPOSAL </{PLAYER_ANSWER_TAG}>
    <{PROPOSED_TRADE_TAG}> {AGENT_ONE} Gives {resources_available_in_game}: amount, ...| {AGENT_TWO} Gives {MONEY_TOKEN}: amount </{PROPOSED_TRADE_TAG}>

    B) Accept the trade by saying:
    <{PLAYER_ANSWER_TAG}> {ACCEPTING_TAG} </{PLAYER_ANSWER_TAG}>
    <{PROPOSED_TRADE_TAG}> NONE </{PROPOSED_TRADE_TAG}>

    C) Reject and end the game:
    <{PLAYER_ANSWER_TAG}> {REJECTION_TAG} </{PLAYER_ANSWER_TAG}>
    <{PROPOSED_TRADE_TAG}> NONE </{PROPOSED_TRADE_TAG}>

    Note: The game will end if one of the players {ACCEPTING_TAG} OR {REJECTION_TAG}. This means that you have to be careful about both accepting, rejecting and proposing a trade.

2. You are allowed at most {maximum_number_of_proposals} proposals of your own to complete the game, after which you can only reply with {ACCEPTING_TAG} or {REJECTION_TAG}.
DO NOT propose a new trade after {maximum_number_of_proposals} proposals. Your limit for proposals is {maximum_number_of_proposals}.

3. At each turn send messages to each other by using the following format:

<{MESSAGE_TAG}>your message here</{MESSAGE_TAG}>

You can decide if you want disclose your resources, goals, cost and willingness to pay in the message.
```

Here is what you have access to:
```
Object that is being bought/sold: {resources_available_in_game}
<{RESOURCES_TAG}> {starting_initial_resources} </{RESOURCES_TAG}>
<{GOALS_TAG}> {player_goal} </{GOALS_TAG}>,
```

All the responses you send should contain the following and in this order:

```
<{PROPOSAL_COUNT_TAG}> [add here (inclusive of current)] </{PROPOSAL_COUNT_TAG}>
<{RESOURCES_TAG}> [add here] </{RESOURCES_TAG}>
<{GOALS_TAG}> [add here] </{GOALS_TAG}>
<{REASONING_TAG}> [add here] </{REASONING_TAG}>
<{PLAYER_ANSWER_TAG}> [add here] </{PLAYER_ANSWER_TAG}>
<{PROPOSED_TRADE_TAG}> [add here] </{PROPOSED_TRADE_TAG}>
<{MESSAGE_TAG}> [add here] </{MESSAGE_TAG}
```

Please be sure to include all.
