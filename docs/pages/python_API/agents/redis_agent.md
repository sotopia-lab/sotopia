# RedisAgent Class Documentation

## Overview

The `RedisAgent` class is an implementation of a base agent that interacts with a server using Redis as a message broker. This class extends from `BaseAgent`, and leverages a FastAPI server to handle messaging tasks.

## Dependencies

- `asyncio`: Provides support for asynchronous operations.
- `logging`: Used for logging messages.
- `os`: Used to fetch environment variables.
- `uuid`: Used for generating unique UUIDs.
- `aiohttp`: Asynchronous HTTP client/server framework.
- `pydantic`: Data validation and settings management using Python-type annotations.
- `requests`: HTTP library for sending HTTP requests.

## Class Definition

```python
class RedisAgent(BaseAgent[Observation, AgentAction]):
    """An agent use redis as a message broker."""
```

### `__init__` Method

Initializes the Redis agent.

**Parameters**
- `agent_name` (Optional[str]): Name of the agent.
- `uuid_str` (Optional[str]): Unique identifier for the agent.
- `session_id` (Optional[str]): Unique identifier for the session, defaults to a newly generated UUID.
- `agent_profile` (Optional[AgentProfile]): Profile details of the agent.

```python
def __init__(self, agent_name: str | None = None, uuid_str: str | None = None, session_id: str | None = None, agent_profile: AgentProfile | None = None) -> None:
```

**Details**
- Sets the session ID using the provided `session_id` or generates a new UUID.
- Sets the sender ID using a generated UUID.
- Sets a pre-defined `model_name` to "redis".
- Checks for the existence of the `FASTAPI_URL` environment variable and sets `_URL` accordingly.
- Attempts to connect to a server using the generated session and sender IDs.

### `act` Method

To be implemented.

**Parameters**
- `obs` (Observation): The observation data.

**Returns**
- `AgentAction`: An action based on the observation.

```python
def act(self, obs: Observation) -> AgentAction:
    raise NotImplementedError
```

### `aact` Method

Asynchronous method to act upon receiving an observation.

**Parameters**
- `obs` (Observation): The observation data.

**Returns**
- `AgentAction`: An action based on the observation.

```python
async def aact(self, obs: Observation) -> AgentAction:
```

**Details**
- Receives and processes the observation.
- Posts observation data to the server.
- Unlocks the server for the client, waits for client's message, and processes the received message to determine the next action.
- Validates and parses the received message as an `AgentAction`.

### `reset` Method

Resets the agent's state.

**Parameters**
- `reset_reason` (str): Reason for resetting the agent.

```python
def reset(self, reset_reason: str = "") -> None:
```

**Details**
- Uses the `super().reset()` method to reset the base class.
- Attempts to send a reset reason to the server if provided.

## Summary

The `RedisAgent` class provides an interface for interacting with a server using Redis as a message broker. It contains methods for initializing the agent, handling observations asynchronously, and resetting the agent's state.
